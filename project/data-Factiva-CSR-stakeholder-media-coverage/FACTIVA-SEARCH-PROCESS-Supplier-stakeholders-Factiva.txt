I adapted Flammer's (2013) process for searching for coverage of environmental stakeholder corporate social responsibility coverage. 
I searched for CSR related to suppliers by searching the Factiva database for "corporate social responsibility" AND "supplier*" for All dates, all authors, all companies, all subjects, all industries, all regions, and all languages.

The search returned 10,956 results (10,772 documents) (Duplicates set to "Off"). Dow Jones publications had 727 hits, Web News 180, Blogs 4, Pictures 0, and Multimedia 0.
