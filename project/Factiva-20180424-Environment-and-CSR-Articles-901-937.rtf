At 5:30 in the Namibian enclave Swakopmund, whose century-old buildings still bear the imprint of German colonization, solitary men in khaki uniforms emerge from houses and apartment complexes, the white reflective strips on their pants flashing as they walk briskly through the darkness. They are not African but Chinese. No one else is stirring in the Atlantic Coast town as the men converge on a tidy house on Libertina Amathila Avenue, the only one in the neighborhood with its lights ablaze.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Dylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o\u8217\'20\'19clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. \u8212\'20\'14 China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.\par \par \uc2 An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u8323\'20\'83O\u8328\'20\'88, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u8220\'20\'1CWe had a big ceremony that day,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says.\par \par \uc2 One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u8217\'20\'19s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u8217\'20\'19s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u8217\'20\'19s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future \u8212\'20\'14 his own and his country\u8217\'20\'19s \u8212\'20\'14 under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. \u8220\'20\'1CI never imagined,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1CI would end up halfway around the world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s gravitational pull can be felt today in every nook of the globe. Few countries feel the tug more strongly than Namibia, a wind-swept nation with a population of 2.4 million \u8212\'20\'14 barely a tenth the size of Beijing\u8217\'20\'19s \u8212\'20\'14 some 8,000 miles away from the Chinese capital. The desert where the Husab mine has materialized in recent years used to be known only for the presence of Welwitschia mirabilis, the short, droopy national plant that grows just two leaves \u8212\'20\'14 and can live for more than 1,000 years. Now, in little more than 1,000 days, China\u8217\'20\'19s reach has spread far beyond the uranium mine.\par \par \uc2 Just north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u8212\'20\'14 in some cases \u8212\'20\'14 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.\par \par \uc2 This small outpost offers a glimpse of what may be the largest global trade-and-investment spree in history. Driven by economics (a hunger for resources and new markets) and politics (a longing for strategic allies), Chinese companies and workers have rushed into all parts of the world. In 2000, only five countries counted China as their largest trading partner; today, more than 100 countries do, from Australia to the United States. The drumbeat of proposed projects never stops: a military operating base, China\u8217\'20\'19s first overseas, in Djibouti; an $8 billion high-speed railway through Nigeria; an almost-fantastical canal across Nicaragua expected to cost $50 billion. Even as China\u8217\'20\'19s boom slows down, its most ambitious scheme is still ramping up: With the \u8220\'20\'1COne Belt, One Road\u8221\'20\'1D initiative \u8212\'20\'14 its name a reference to trade routes \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  has spoken of putting $1.6 trillion over the next decade into infrastructure and development throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The scheme would dwarf the United States\u8217\'20\'19 post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe.\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with Africa goes back to the 1960s, when Chairman Mao Zedong promoted solidarity with the developing world \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CYa Fei La,\u8221\'20\'1D as he called it, using the first syllables for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though it was poor and mired in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China won new allies in Africa by finishing, in 1976, a 1,156-mile railroad through the bush from Tanzania to Zambia. Aid continued to trickle in, but there were no other big projects for nearly 30 years, as China focused on building up its domestic economy, following its leader Deng Xiaoping\u8217\'20\'19s prescription to \u8220\'20\'1Chide your strength and bide your time.\u8221\'20\'1D That ended in the 2000s, when Beijing, recognizing the need for foreign resources and allies to fuel its economic growth, exhorted the nation\u8217\'20\'19s companies to \u8220\'20\'1Cgo out\u8221\'20\'1D into the world.\par \par \uc2 Today, if you take the red-eye flight from Shanghai to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, chances are you\u8217\'20\'19ll be seated among Chinese workers heading to a construction site in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, a cotton-processing plant in Mozambique, a telecom project in Nigeria. China\u8217\'20\'19s trade with African nations has increased fortyfold in the past 20 years. The workers and migrants carrying out China\u8217\'20\'19s global vision are now so ubiquitous in Africa \u8212\'20\'14 as many as a million of them, according to one estimate \u8212\'20\'14 that when my wife and I wandered into a Hunanese restaurant in Addis, the red-faced workers devouring twice-cooked pork blurted out: \u8220\'20\'1CAh, laowai laile!\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CForeigners have come!\u8221\'20\'1D It seemed rude to point out that they were foreigners, too.\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s advances have come as the West seems to be retreating. United States engagement in Asia, Africa and Latin America declined after the Cold War, when the regions served as proxies for superpower rivalries. China\u8217\'20\'19s rise and the wars in the Middle East also pulled away resources and attention. And now, with Washington raising doubts about global agreements on issues like free trade and climate change, Beijing has more leverage to push its own initiatives and show its capacity for global leadership. President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s disdain for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has already made Beijing\u8217\'20\'19s trade proposals, which exclude the United States, more appealing. \u8220\'20\'1CIn certain parts of the world, the relative inattention of the Trump administration is definitely creating an opening for China to fill,\u8221\'20\'1D says David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2  and author of the 2013 book \u8220\'20\'1CChina Goes Global.\u8221\'20\'1D But \u8220\'20\'1CChina remains very much a partial power \u8212\'20\'14 and only offers other countries an economic relationship.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u8217\'20\'19s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u8217\'20\'19re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u8217\'20\'19s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u8217\'20\'19s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u8220\'20\'1Call-weather friends.\u8221\'20\'1D (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)\par \par \uc2 In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u8220\'20\'1CWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u8221\'20\'1D Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s minister of finance, told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Chinese say, \u8216\'20\'18We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u8217\'20\'19s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u8220\'20\'1Cwin-win cooperation.\u8221\'20\'1D And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u8212\'20\'14 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u8212\'20\'14 might never be built without them. China\u8217\'20\'19s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u8220\'20\'1CWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u8221\'20\'1D Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u8220\'20\'1CNow we\u8217\'20\'19re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u8217\'20\'19t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u8212\'20\'14 financed by the Chinese \u8212\'20\'14 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u8212\'20\'14 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u8212\'20\'14 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u8217\'20\'19s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u8220\'20\'1CFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u8212\'20\'14 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u8212\'20\'14 or the worst,\u8221\'20\'1D says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u8220\'20\'1CChina in Africa Podcast.\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CThe beauty is in the complexity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The sign on the lime green cement wall outside the restaurant, written in Chinese, read \u8220\'20\'1CYe Shanghai\u8221\'20\'1D: \u8220\'20\'1CShanghai Nights.\u8221\'20\'1D Inside, the lunch crowd was already gone, but six middle-aged Chinese men and women \u8212\'20\'14 including \uc2 James Shen\uc2  and his wife, Rose, the proprietors \u8212\'20\'14 crowded around a table peeling prawns and sucking heartily on the shells. Nobody spoke. Blaring from the flat-screen television on the wall was a special report on CCTV-4, a channel from China\u8217\'20\'19s state television broadcaster, breathlessly describing the powers of the People\u8217\'20\'19s Liberation Army. When a double row of explosions erupted in the sea, Rose exclaimed, \u8220\'20\'1CWah, our China is so strong!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The couple\u8217\'20\'19s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most remote places: I\u8217\'20\'19ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u8220\'20\'1CMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u8221\'20\'1D Rose told me. \u8220\'20\'1CBut we\u8217\'20\'19re still Chinese first and foremost.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Like many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 and thousands more across Africa.\par \par \uc2 On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u8217\'20\'19s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u8217\'20\'19s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u8217\'20\'19s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u8217\'20\'19 poor quality \u8212\'20\'14 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u8220\'20\'1CMany Namibian children didn\u8217\'20\'19t even have shoes before we got here,\u8221\'20\'1D Wu says. \u8220\'20\'1CThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.\par \par \uc2 Huang\u8217\'20\'19s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s elections since its independence \u8212\'20\'14 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u8217\'20\'19s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s founding father, as \u8220\'20\'1Cmy special adviser.\u8221\'20\'1D During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u8217\'20\'19s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u8212\'20\'14 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)\par \par \uc2 Huang\u8217\'20\'19s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u8217\'20\'19s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u8217\'20\'19s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u8217\'20\'19s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u8217\'20\'19s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u8220\'20\'1CI kept warning Jack,\u8221\'20\'1D says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u8220\'20\'1C\u8201\'20\'09\u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t get too close to the fire. You\u8217\'20\'19ll burn your fingers.\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The exact number of Chinese living in Namibia remains the subject of contentious debate. No definitive data exist, and the constant ebb and flow of contract workers muddies the picture. Last fall, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s home-affairs ministry raised alarms when it claimed that 100,000 Chinese nationals live in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 a figure that would be equivalent to 4 percent of the population. More conservative estimates run between 10,000 and 20,000. It is clear, however, that in Namibia and all across the developing world, the older generation of long-term immigrants is being eclipsed by China\u8217\'20\'19s new diaspora: younger, more educated workers going abroad to get experience \u8212\'20\'14 and make a small fortune \u8212\'20\'14 before returning to China. \u8220\'20\'1CWe were among the first ones here,\u8221\'20\'1D Rose Shen says, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut now there are Chinese everywhere.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u8217\'20\'19s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u8217\'20\'19t expected to venture far beyond his village\u8217\'20\'19s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u8212\'20\'14 a legacy of the government\u8217\'20\'19s restrictive family-planning policy \u8212\'20\'14 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u8220\'20\'1Cbare branch\u8221\'20\'1D (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.\par \par \uc2 When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u8220\'20\'1CI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u8221\'20\'1D he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u8217\'20\'19an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u8217\'20\'19s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u8220\'20\'1CShe didn\u8217\'20\'19t even recognize me,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.\par \par \uc2 On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u8217\'20\'19s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u8217\'20\'19 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d like to go home, too,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u8217\'20\'19m making now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the hardscrabble hills of Sichuan Province, the parents of the uranium miner Dylan Teng still work as farmers, growing rice and maize in a hillside hamlet where most families share the same surname. Their village, called Tengjiayan (or Teng Family Rock), had only a primary school, so Teng left to study in nearby Guang\u8217\'20\'19an, the birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, and then went on to college in China\u8217\'20\'19s northeast. It was a long road that was about to grow longer. \u8220\'20\'1CI never thought I\u8217\'20\'19d go abroad,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cso I didn\u8217\'20\'19t even try in my English classes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In Teng\u8217\'20\'19s first job after graduation \u8212\'20\'14 at the Beijing-based \uc2 Uranium Resources Company\uc2 , a C.G.N. subsidiary \u8212\'20\'14 he learned about the company\u8217\'20\'19s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u8217\'20\'19s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.\par \par \uc2 As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u8217\'20\'19s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u8220\'20\'1CThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says.\par \par \uc2 To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u8217\'20\'19s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.\par \par \uc2 As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u8220\'20\'1CHusab was my salvation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 There is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u8217\'20\'19s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 88 percent of China\u8217\'20\'19s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u8212\'20\'14 and shed the ignominious title of world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u8212\'20\'14 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)\par \par \uc2 This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u8217\'20\'19s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u8217\'20\'19s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  that the plan is \u8220\'20\'1Cinsane.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 C.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u8217\'20\'19s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u8212\'20\'14 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.\par \par \uc2 Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u8217\'20\'19s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u8217\'20\'19s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u8221\'20\'1D she told me, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut the implementation can be hell.\u8221\'20\'1D Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u8217\'20\'19t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u8217\'20\'19 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.\par \par \uc2 For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u8217\'20\'19s convenient for them to review and plan \u8212\'20\'14 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u8212\'20\'14 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u8220\'20\'1CWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u8217\'20\'19s all part of the \u8216\'20\'18going out\u8217\'20\'19 policy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mining is hardly China\u8217\'20\'19s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u8217\'20\'19s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u8212\'20\'14 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u8212\'20\'14 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u8217\'20\'19s incursion into Africa.\par \par \uc2 Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u8221\'20\'1D says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u8217\'20\'19s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u8220\'20\'1CWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Namibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u8220\'20\'1CIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One morning in late December, the Namibian conservation biologist Chris Brown was working alone in his Windhoek office when he heard a banging at the gate. Rushing out, he found two angry Chinese men in button-down shirts: the first and second secretaries from the Chinese Embassy. One of them threw a crumpled letter through the gate, Brown says, and shouted: \u8220\'20\'1CThese are lies! You are making China look bad in the eyes of the world!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u8212\'20\'14 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u8217\'20\'19s own Namibian Chamber of \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.\par \par \uc2 Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u8212\'20\'14 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou are abusing China\u8217\'20\'19s good nature,\u8221\'20\'1D one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u8220\'20\'1COnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u8221\'20\'1D Brown replied. \u8220\'20\'1CI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u8220\'20\'1CThey got quieter and quieter,\u8221\'20\'1D Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u8220\'20\'1Crotten apples\u8221\'20\'1D tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u8220\'20\'1CListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u8221\'20\'1D he says he argued. \u8220\'20\'1COr we can come together to solve this problem.\u8221\'20\'1D The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.\par \par \uc2 One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u8217\'20\'19s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u8212\'20\'14 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cso they have to be part of the solution.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Poaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u8220\'20\'1CLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u8221\'20\'1D my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u8221\'20\'1D In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u8220\'20\'1CBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u8221\'20\'1D says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u8220\'20\'1CBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Public anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u8217\'20\'19s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u8217\'20\'19s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u8212\'20\'14 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.\par \par \uc2 Three months after Brown\u8217\'20\'19s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u8217\'20\'19s recent ban on all ivory sales \u8212\'20\'14 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star \uc2 Yao Ming\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u8217\'20\'19s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u8217\'20\'19 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.\par \par \uc2 Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u8217\'20\'19s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u8212\'20\'14 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen my \u8216\'20\'18friend\u8217\'20\'19 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u8221\'20\'1D Geingob told a local paper later. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Huang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u8212\'20\'14 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.\par \par \uc2 Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u8220\'20\'1Ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u8221\'20\'1D The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)\par \par \uc2 Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u8217\'20\'19s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u8220\'20\'1CAll the while they were yelling, \u8216\'20\'18Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u8217\'20\'19s the rhino horn?\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D Xia recalls. \u8220\'20\'1CI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As the afternoon sun weakens over the Husab Uranium Mine, most of the 2,000 or so Namibian workers return to their desert barracks. Teng and the other Chinese engineers board buses for the ride back through the moonscape to Swakopmund and the little house on Amathila Avenue. After sharing another Chinese meal together, the men disperse. Teng walks back to his apartment, where he will spend a few hours on his computer doing administrative and supervisory tasks. \u8220\'20\'1COur real secret,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says, \u8220\'20\'1Cis that we work 12-hour days while everybody else works eight.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a chilly Saturday in April \u8212\'20\'14 the antipodal winter is coming \u8212\'20\'14 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.\par \par \uc2 In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive \u8212\'20\'14 or latitude \u8212\'20\'14 to venture out into the alien \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea \u8212\'20\'14 but had no idea where it was.\par \par \uc2 The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China \u8212\'20\'14 thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue \u8212\'20\'14 Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He\u8217\'20\'19d married the visitor \u8212\'20\'14 mission accomplished \u8212\'20\'14 joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng\u8217\'20\'19s other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China\u8217\'20\'19s continued rise. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an important thing for China, \u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cand I want to be a part of it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises \u8212\'20\'14 and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It\u8217\'20\'19s not just the shared food, culture or language \u8212\'20\'14 or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 our newsletter}}}\uc2  to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

At 5:30 in the Namibian enclave Swakopmund, whose century-old buildings still bear the imprint of German colonization, solitary men in khaki uniforms emerge from houses and apartment complexes, the white reflective strips on their pants flashing as they walk briskly through the darkness. They are not African but Chinese. No one else is stirring in the Atlantic Coast town as the men converge on a tidy house on Libertina Amathila Avenue, the only one in the neighborhood with its lights ablaze.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Dylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o\u8217\'20\'19clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. \u8212\'20\'14 China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.\par \par \uc2 An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u8323\'20\'83O\u8328\'20\'88, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). \u8220\'20\'1CWe had a big ceremony that day,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says.\par \par \uc2 One of the few university graduates from his village in China\u8217\'20\'19s southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab\u8217\'20\'19s significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng\u8217\'20\'19s homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future \u8212\'20\'14 his own and his country\u8217\'20\'19s \u8212\'20\'14 under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. \u8220\'20\'1CI never imagined,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1CI would end up halfway around the world.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s gravitational pull can be felt today in every nook of the globe. Few countries feel the tug more strongly than Namibia, a wind-swept nation with a population of 2.4 million \u8212\'20\'14 barely a tenth the size of Beijing\u8217\'20\'19s \u8212\'20\'14 some 8,000 miles away from the Chinese capital. The desert where the Husab mine has materialized in recent years used to be known only for the presence of Welwitschia mirabilis, the short, droopy national plant that grows just two leaves \u8212\'20\'14 and can live for more than 1,000 years. Now, in little more than 1,000 days, China\u8217\'20\'19s reach has spread far beyond the uranium mine.\par \par \uc2 Just north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and \u8212\'20\'14 in some cases \u8212\'20\'14 illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.\par \par \uc2 This small outpost offers a glimpse of what may be the largest global trade-and-investment spree in history. Driven by economics (a hunger for resources and new markets) and politics (a longing for strategic allies), Chinese companies and workers have rushed into all parts of the world. In 2000, only five countries counted China as their largest trading partner; today, more than 100 countries do, from Australia to the United States. The drumbeat of proposed projects never stops: a military operating base, China\u8217\'20\'19s first overseas, in Djibouti; an $8 billion high-speed railway through Nigeria; an almost-fantastical canal across Nicaragua expected to cost $50 billion. Even as China\u8217\'20\'19s boom slows down, its most ambitious scheme is still ramping up: With the \u8220\'20\'1COne Belt, One Road\u8221\'20\'1D initiative \u8212\'20\'14 its name a reference to trade routes \u8212\'20\'14 President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  has spoken of putting $1.6 trillion over the next decade into infrastructure and development throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The scheme would dwarf the United States\u8217\'20\'19 post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe.\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s relationship with Africa goes back to the 1960s, when Chairman Mao Zedong promoted solidarity with the developing world \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CYa Fei La,\u8221\'20\'1D as he called it, using the first syllables for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though it was poor and mired in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China won new allies in Africa by finishing, in 1976, a 1,156-mile railroad through the bush from Tanzania to Zambia. Aid continued to trickle in, but there were no other big projects for nearly 30 years, as China focused on building up its domestic economy, following its leader Deng Xiaoping\u8217\'20\'19s prescription to \u8220\'20\'1Chide your strength and bide your time.\u8221\'20\'1D That ended in the 2000s, when Beijing, recognizing the need for foreign resources and allies to fuel its economic growth, exhorted the nation\u8217\'20\'19s companies to \u8220\'20\'1Cgo out\u8221\'20\'1D into the world.\par \par \uc2 Today, if you take the red-eye flight from Shanghai to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, chances are you\u8217\'20\'19ll be seated among Chinese workers heading to a construction site in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, a cotton-processing plant in Mozambique, a telecom project in Nigeria. China\u8217\'20\'19s trade with African nations has increased fortyfold in the past 20 years. The workers and migrants carrying out China\u8217\'20\'19s global vision are now so ubiquitous in Africa \u8212\'20\'14 as many as a million of them, according to one estimate \u8212\'20\'14 that when my wife and I wandered into a Hunanese restaurant in Addis, the red-faced workers devouring twice-cooked pork blurted out: \u8220\'20\'1CAh, laowai laile!\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CForeigners have come!\u8221\'20\'1D It seemed rude to point out that they were foreigners, too.\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s advances have come as the West seems to be retreating. United States engagement in Asia, Africa and Latin America declined after the Cold War, when the regions served as proxies for superpower rivalries. China\u8217\'20\'19s rise and the wars in the Middle East also pulled away resources and attention. And now, with Washington raising doubts about global agreements on issues like free trade and climate change, Beijing has more leverage to push its own initiatives and show its capacity for global leadership. President Trump\u8217\'20\'19s disdain for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has already made Beijing\u8217\'20\'19s trade proposals, which exclude the United States, more appealing. \u8220\'20\'1CIn certain parts of the world, the relative inattention of the Trump administration is definitely creating an opening for China to fill,\u8221\'20\'1D says David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2  and author of the 2013 book \u8220\'20\'1CChina Goes Global.\u8221\'20\'1D But \u8220\'20\'1CChina remains very much a partial power \u8212\'20\'14 and only offers other countries an economic relationship.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Still, for a nation like Namibia, China\u8217\'20\'19s pitches can be irresistible partly because they\u8217\'20\'19re rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement\u8217\'20\'19s liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People\u8217\'20\'19s Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries \u8220\'20\'1Call-weather friends.\u8221\'20\'1D (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)\par \par \uc2 In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. \u8220\'20\'1CWe welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,\u8221\'20\'1D Calle Schlettwein, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s minister of finance, told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Chinese say, \u8216\'20\'18We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D But they have their conditions, too, he says. \u8220\'20\'1CThey want de facto total control over everything, so it\u8217\'20\'19s difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 China\u8217\'20\'19s leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call \u8220\'20\'1Cwin-win cooperation.\u8221\'20\'1D And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing \u8212\'20\'14 roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks \u8212\'20\'14 might never be built without them. China\u8217\'20\'19s investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. \u8220\'20\'1CWe helped Namibia gain its political liberation,\u8221\'20\'1D Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. \u8220\'20\'1CNow we\u8217\'20\'19re helping it fight for economic emancipation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn\u8217\'20\'19t look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans \u8212\'20\'14 financed by the Chinese \u8212\'20\'14 they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals \u8212\'20\'14 including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife \u8212\'20\'14 has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid\u8217\'20\'19s legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: \u8220\'20\'1CFeeding Namibia to the Chinese.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future \u8212\'20\'14 or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa \u8212\'20\'14 or the worst,\u8221\'20\'1D says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly \u8220\'20\'1CChina in Africa Podcast.\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CThe beauty is in the complexity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The sign on the limegreen cement wall outside the restaurant, written in Chinese, read \u8220\'20\'1CYe Shanghai\u8221\'20\'1D: \u8220\'20\'1CShanghai Nights.\u8221\'20\'1D Inside, the lunch crowd was already gone, but six middle-aged Chinese men and women \u8212\'20\'14 including \uc2 James Shen\uc2  and his wife, Rose, the proprietors \u8212\'20\'14 crowded around a table peeling prawns and sucking heartily on the shells. Nobody spoke. Blaring from the flat-screen television on the wall was a special report on CCTV-4, a channel from China\u8217\'20\'19s state television broadcaster, breathlessly describing the powers of the People\u8217\'20\'19s Liberation Army. When a double row of explosions erupted in the sea, Rose exclaimed, \u8220\'20\'1CWah, our China is so strong!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The couple\u8217\'20\'19s restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world\u8217\'20\'19s most remote places: I\u8217\'20\'19ve bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. \u8220\'20\'1CMy husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,\u8221\'20\'1D Rose told me. \u8220\'20\'1CBut we\u8217\'20\'19re still Chinese first and foremost.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Like many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 and thousands more across Africa.\par \par \uc2 On a recent Sunday in Windhoek\u8217\'20\'19s Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city\u8217\'20\'19s industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children\u8217\'20\'19s toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods\u8217\'20\'19 poor quality \u8212\'20\'14 and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. \u8220\'20\'1CMany Namibian children didn\u8217\'20\'19t even have shoes before we got here,\u8221\'20\'1D Wu says. \u8220\'20\'1CThe people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.\par \par \uc2 Huang\u8217\'20\'19s success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s elections since its independence \u8212\'20\'14 the kind of stability that appeals to China\u8217\'20\'19s rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s founding father, as \u8220\'20\'1Cmy special adviser.\u8221\'20\'1D During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob\u8217\'20\'19s political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars \u8212\'20\'14 about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)\par \par \uc2 Huang\u8217\'20\'19s friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang\u8217\'20\'19s charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang\u8217\'20\'19s philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob\u8217\'20\'19s family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang\u8217\'20\'19s friends worry about his courting of the powerful. \u8220\'20\'1CI kept warning Jack,\u8221\'20\'1D says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. \u8220\'20\'1C\u8201\'20\'09\u8216\'20\'18Don\u8217\'20\'19t get too close to the fire. You\u8217\'20\'19ll burn your fingers.\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The exact number of Chinese living in Namibia remains the subject of contentious debate. No definitive data exist, and the constant ebb and flow of contract workers muddies the picture. Last fall, Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s home-affairs ministry raised alarms when it claimed that 100,000 Chinese nationals live in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 a figure that would be equivalent to 4 percent of the population. More conservative estimates run between 10,000 and 20,000. It is clear, however, that in Namibia and all across the developing world, the older generation of long-term immigrants is being eclipsed by China\u8217\'20\'19s new diaspora: younger, more educated workers going abroad to get experience \u8212\'20\'14 and make a small fortune \u8212\'20\'14 before returning to China. \u8220\'20\'1CWe were among the first ones here,\u8221\'20\'1D Rose Shen says, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut now there are Chinese everywhere.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Sean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China\u8217\'20\'19s Shaanxi province, he wasn\u8217\'20\'19t expected to venture far beyond his village\u8217\'20\'19s orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women \u8212\'20\'14 a legacy of the government\u8217\'20\'19s restrictive family-planning policy \u8212\'20\'14 an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a \u8220\'20\'1Cbare branch\u8221\'20\'1D (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.\par \par \uc2 When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. \u8220\'20\'1CI thought this must be a case of human trafficking,\u8221\'20\'1D he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi\u8217\'20\'19an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend\u8217\'20\'19s parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. \u8220\'20\'1CShe didn\u8217\'20\'19t even recognize me,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.\par \par \uc2 On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe\u8217\'20\'19s Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues\u8217\'20\'19 return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19d like to go home, too,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I\u8217\'20\'19m making now.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In the hardscrabblehills of Sichuan Province, the parents of the uranium miner Dylan Teng still work as farmers, growing rice and maize in a hillside hamlet where most families share the same surname. Their village, called Tengjiayan (or Teng Family Rock), had only a primary school, so Teng left to study in nearby Guang\u8217\'20\'19an, the birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, and then went on to college in China\u8217\'20\'19s northeast. It was a long road that was about to grow longer. \u8220\'20\'1CI never thought I\u8217\'20\'19d go abroad,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cso I didn\u8217\'20\'19t even try in my English classes.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In Teng\u8217\'20\'19s first job after graduation \u8212\'20\'14 at the Beijing-based \uc2 Uranium Resources Company\uc2 , a C.G.N. subsidiary \u8212\'20\'14 he learned about the company\u8217\'20\'19s mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China\u8217\'20\'19s largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.\par \par \uc2 As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab\u8217\'20\'19s open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. \u8220\'20\'1CThe pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says.\par \par \uc2 To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China\u8217\'20\'19s state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.\par \par \uc2 As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, \u8220\'20\'1CHusab was my salvation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 There is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China\u8217\'20\'19s ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 88 percent of China\u8217\'20\'19s energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals \u8212\'20\'14 and shed the ignominious title of world\u8217\'20\'19s biggest producer of greenhouse gases \u8212\'20\'14 China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)\par \par \uc2 This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world\u8217\'20\'19s top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China\u8217\'20\'19s safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  that the plan is \u8220\'20\'1Cinsane.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 C.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab\u8217\'20\'19s back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts \u8212\'20\'14 a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.\par \par \uc2 Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union\u8217\'20\'19s secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine\u8217\'20\'19s inaugural event, she was skeptical. \u8220\'20\'1CThe Chinese will promise you heaven,\u8221\'20\'1D she told me, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut the implementation can be hell.\u8221\'20\'1D Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn\u8217\'20\'19t sign a project labor agreement protecting workers\u8217\'20\'19 wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.\par \par \uc2 For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it\u8217\'20\'19s convenient for them to review and plan \u8212\'20\'14 but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment \u8212\'20\'14 at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: \u8220\'20\'1CWe have to help and support our brother companies. It\u8217\'20\'19s all part of the \u8216\'20\'18going out\u8217\'20\'19 policy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Mining is hardly China\u8217\'20\'19s only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China\u8217\'20\'19s state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers \u8212\'20\'14 an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo \u8212\'20\'14 and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China\u8217\'20\'19s incursion into Africa.\par \par \uc2 Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Such criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,\u8221\'20\'1D says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang\u8217\'20\'19s Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. \u8220\'20\'1CWe bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Namibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: \u8220\'20\'1CIt sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One morning in late December, the Namibian conservation biologist Chris Brown was working alone in his Windhoek office when he heard a banging at the gate. Rushing out, he found two angry Chinese men in button-down shirts: the first and second secretaries from the Chinese Embassy. One of them threw a crumpled letter through the gate, Brown says, and shouted: \u8220\'20\'1CThese are lies! You are making China look bad in the eyes of the world!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before \u8212\'20\'14 and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown\u8217\'20\'19s own Namibian Chamber of \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia \u8212\'20\'14 and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.\par \par \uc2 Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns \u8212\'20\'14 all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou are abusing China\u8217\'20\'19s good nature,\u8221\'20\'1D one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. \u8220\'20\'1COnly a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNo, Chinese demand is driving all of this,\u8221\'20\'1D Brown replied. \u8220\'20\'1CI think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. \u8220\'20\'1CThey got quieter and quieter,\u8221\'20\'1D Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few \u8220\'20\'1Crotten apples\u8221\'20\'1D tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. \u8220\'20\'1CListen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,\u8221\'20\'1D he says he argued. \u8220\'20\'1COr we can come together to solve this problem.\u8221\'20\'1D The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.\par \par \uc2 One of the most troubling dimensions of China\u8217\'20\'19s global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers \u8212\'20\'14 and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIn a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,\u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cso they have to be part of the solution.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Poaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. \u8220\'20\'1CLocals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,\u8221\'20\'1D my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. \u8220\'20\'1CThe horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.\u8221\'20\'1D In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. \u8220\'20\'1CBlacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,\u8221\'20\'1D says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. \u8220\'20\'1CBut now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Public anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia\u8217\'20\'19s only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area\u8217\'20\'19s sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China\u8217\'20\'19s soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters \u8212\'20\'14 all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.\par \par \uc2 Three months after Brown\u8217\'20\'19s letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China\u8217\'20\'19s recent ban on all ivory sales \u8212\'20\'14 and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star \uc2 Yao Ming\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown\u8217\'20\'19s invitation, he will visit the rhinos\u8217\'20\'19 habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.\par \par \uc2 Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek\u8217\'20\'19s international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million \u8212\'20\'14 the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. \u8220\'20\'1CWhen my \u8216\'20\'18friend\u8217\'20\'19 was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,\u8221\'20\'1D Geingob told a local paper later. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Huang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed \u8212\'20\'14 the power broker was suddenly a pariah.\par \par \uc2 Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is \u8220\'20\'1Ctrying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.\u8221\'20\'1D The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)\par \par \uc2 Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang\u8217\'20\'19s associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. \u8220\'20\'1CAll the while they were yelling, \u8216\'20\'18Rhino horn, rhino horn, where\u8217\'20\'19s the rhino horn?\u8217\'20\'19\u8201\'20\'09\u8221\'20\'1D Xia recalls. \u8220\'20\'1CI was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As the afternoon sun weakens over the Husab Uranium Mine, most of the 2,000 or so Namibian workers return to their desert barracks. Teng and the other Chinese engineers board buses for the ride back through the moonscape to Swakopmund and the little house on Amathila Avenue. After sharing another Chinese meal together, the men disperse. Teng walks back to his apartment, where he will spend a few hours on his computer doing administrative and supervisory tasks. \u8220\'20\'1COur real secret,\u8221\'20\'1D Teng says, \u8220\'20\'1Cis that we work 12-hour days while everybody else works eight.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a chilly Saturday in April \u8212\'20\'14 the antipodal winter is coming \u8212\'20\'14 and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.\par \par \uc2 In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive \u8212\'20\'14 or latitude \u8212\'20\'14 to venture out into the alien \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea \u8212\'20\'14 but had no idea where it was.\par \par \uc2 The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China \u8212\'20\'14 thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue \u8212\'20\'14 Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He\u8217\'20\'19d married the visitor \u8212\'20\'14 mission accomplished \u8212\'20\'14 joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng\u8217\'20\'19s other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China\u8217\'20\'19s continued rise. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is an important thing for China, \u8221\'20\'1D he says, \u8220\'20\'1Cand I want to be a part of it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises \u8212\'20\'14 and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It\u8217\'20\'19s not just the shared food, culture or language \u8212\'20\'14 or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/magazine"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 our newsletter}}}\uc2  to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \par \uc2 Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

At 5:30 in the Namibian enclave Swakopmund, whose century-old buildings still bear the imprint of German colonization, solitary men in khaki uniforms emerge from houses and apartment complexes, the white reflective strips on their pants flashing as they walk briskly through the darkness. They are not African but Chinese. No one else is stirring in the Atlantic Coast town as the men converge on a tidy house on Libertina Amathila Avenue, the only one in the neighborhood with its lights ablaze.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Dylan Teng, a boyish 29-year-old engineer with a brush cut and wire-rimmed glasses, is among the last to arrive. Just as he has done nearly every day since landing in Namibia three and a half years ago, Teng joins the others in wolfing down a breakfast of steamed buns and rice porridge. He picks up a packed lunch prepared by a company chef and at precisely 6 o'clock, with stars still glimmering overhead, he boards a bus emblazoned with the letters C.G.N. -- China General Nuclear, a state-owned behemoth that owns the biggest Chinese project in all of Africa.\par \par \uc2 An hour later, as the sun clears the horizon, the bus winds through a craggy moonscape and descends to the Husab Uranium Mine, a $4.6 billion investment that is the second-largest uranium mine in the world. Teng has made this trip nearly a thousand times, but Husab always seems like a mirage: a virtual city stretching seven miles across the desert floor, from two vast open pits being gouged out of the rocky substratum to a processing plant that, on the last working day of 2016, produced its first drums of U\u226\'00\'E2\u8218\'20\'1A\u402\'01\'92O\u226\'00\'E2\u8218\'20\'1A\u710\'02\'C6, the yellowcake that can be used to generate nuclear power (and also to make weapons). ''We had a big ceremony that day,'' Teng says.\par \par \uc2 One of the few university graduates from his village in China's southwestern Sichuan Province, Teng is keenly aware of Husab's significance. It is not simply a lifeline for Namibia's struggling economy, one that the country estimates will increase its gross domestic product by 5 percent when the mine reaches full production next year. The uranium itself, almost all of which will go to China, will also help turn Teng's homeland into a world leader in nuclear energy and reduce its dependence on coal. In Beijing, where he worked before coming here, Teng lived under the gray blanket of coal-generated pollution that hangs over much of eastern China. Now he is working for the future -- his own and his country's -- under an endless African sky of cobalt blue. ''I never imagined,'' he says, ''I would end up halfway around the world.''\par \par \uc2 China's gravitational pull can be felt today in every nook of the globe. Few countries feel the tug more strongly than Namibia, a wind-swept nation with a population of 2.4 million -- barely a tenth the size of Beijing's -- some 8,000 miles away from the Chinese capital. The desert where the Husab mine has materialized in recent years used to be known only for the presence of Welwitschia mirabilis, the short, droopy national plant that grows just two leaves -- and can live for more than 1,000 years. Now, in little more than 1,000 days, China's reach has spread far beyond the uranium mine.\par \par \uc2 Just north of Swakopmund, a Chinese telemetry station sprouts from the desert floor, its radar dishes pointing skyward to track satellites and space missions. Twenty-five miles south, in Walvis Bay, a state-owned Chinese company is building an artificial peninsula the size of 40 baseball fields as part of a vast port expansion. Other Chinese projects nearby include new highways, a shopping mall, a granite factory and a $400 million fuel depot. Chinese trade flows through the port: shipping containers filled with cement, clothing and machinery coming in; tiles, minerals and -- in some cases -- illegal timber and endangered wildlife heading out to China. The activity is so frenzied that rumors of a proposed naval base in Walvis Bay, though vehemently denied by Chinese officials, do not strike locals as implausible.\par \par \uc2 This small outpost offers a glimpse of what may be the largest global trade-and-investment spree in history. Driven by economics (a hunger for resources and new markets) and politics (a longing for strategic allies), Chinese companies and workers have rushed into all parts of the world. In 2000, only five countries counted China as their largest trading partner; today, more than 100 countries do, from Australia to the United States. The drumbeat of proposed projects never stops: a military operating base, China's first overseas, in Djibouti; an $8 billion high-speed railway through Nigeria; an almost-fantastical canal across Nicaragua expected to cost $50 billion. Even as China's boom slows down, its most ambitious scheme is still ramping up: With the ''One Belt, One Road'' initiative -- its name a reference to trade routes -- President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  has spoken of putting $1.6 trillion over the next decade into infrastructure and development throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The scheme would dwarf the United States' post-World War II Marshall Plan for Europe.\par \par \uc2 China's relationship with Africa goes back to the 1960s, when Chairman Mao Zedong promoted solidarity with the developing world -- ''Ya Fei La,'' as he called it, using the first syllables for Asia, Africa and Latin America. Though it was poor and mired in the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, China won new allies in Africa by finishing, in 1976, a 1,156-mile railroad through the bush from Tanzania to Zambia. Aid continued to trickle in, but there were no other big projects for nearly 30 years, as China focused on building up its domestic economy, following its leader Deng Xiaoping's prescription to ''hide your strength and bide your time.'' That ended in the 2000s, when Beijing, recognizing the need for foreign resources and allies to fuel its economic growth, exhorted the nation's companies to ''go out'' into the world.\par \par \uc2 Today, if you take the red-eye flight from Shanghai to Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, chances are you'll be seated among Chinese workers heading to a construction site in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea, a cotton-processing plant in Mozambique, a telecom project in Nigeria. China's trade with African nations has increased fortyfold in the past 20 years. The workers and migrants carrying out China's global vision are now so ubiquitous in Africa -- as many as a million of them, according to one estimate -- that when my wife and I wandered into a Hunanese restaurant in Addis, the red-faced workers devouring twice-cooked pork blurted out: ''Ah, laowai laile!'' ''Foreigners have come!'' It seemed rude to point out that they were foreigners, too.\par \par \uc2 China's advances have come as the West seems to be retreating. United States engagement in Asia, Africa and Latin America declined after the Cold War, when the regions served as proxies for superpower rivalries. China's rise and the wars in the Middle East also pulled away resources and attention. And now, with Washington raising doubts about global agreements on issues like free trade and climate change, Beijing has more leverage to push its own initiatives and show its capacity for global leadership. President Trump's disdain for the Trans-Pacific Partnership has already made Beijing's trade proposals, which exclude the United States, more appealing. ''In certain parts of the world, the relative inattention of the Trump administration is definitely creating an opening for China to fill,'' says David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at \uc2 George Washington University\uc2  and author of the 2013 book ''China Goes Global.'' But ''China remains very much a partial power -- and only offers other countries an economic relationship.''\par \par \uc2 Still, for a nation like Namibia, China's pitches can be irresistible partly because they're rooted in historical solidarity. Beijing backed the black nationalist movement's liberation struggle against apartheid and its white South African overlords. Sam Nujoma, the leader of the South West Africa People's Organization (Swapo), visited Beijing in search of guns and funds in the early 1960s. When Namibia finally claimed independence in early 1990, with Nujoma as president, China became one of its first diplomatic allies, pronouncing the two countries ''all-weather friends.'' (Beijing was also desperate for allies to break its diplomatic isolation after its violent crackdown on the 1989 democracy movement.)\par \par \uc2 In addition to offering its own history as a model for climbing out of poverty, China provides no-strings financing that, unlike Western aid, is not conditional on such fine points as human rights, clean governance or fiscal restraint. ''We welcomed China very much because, for the first time, it gave us a real alternative to a Western-driven agenda, whether it was South Africa or the Western world,'' Calle Schlettwein, Namibia's minister of finance, told me. ''The Chinese say, 'We want you to be masters of your own destiny, so tell us what you want.' '' But they have their conditions, too, he says. ''They want de facto total control over everything, so it's difficult to bring about a situation that is truly beneficial.''\par \par \uc2 China's leaders insist that its influence is entirely benign, a global exercise in what they call ''win-win cooperation.'' And indeed, many of the projects Chinese companies are pursuing -- roads and railways, ports and pipelines, mines and telecom networks -- might never be built without them. China's investment in the Husab uranium mine, in which C.G.N. subsidiaries hold a 90 percent stake and the Namibian government owns 10 percent, is doing its part to stave off a recession. ''We helped Namibia gain its political liberation,'' Xia Lili, a former Chinese diplomat who now works as an executive at a Chinese company in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, says. ''Now we're helping it fight for economic emancipation.''\par \par \uc2 For some Namibians, however, the flood of Chinese loans and investments doesn't look so much like freedom as it does a new form of colonialism. The infrastructure is welcome, but as projects made possible by loans -- financed by the Chinese -- they have saddled the economy with debt and done little to alleviate the nearly 30 percent unemployment rate. Over the last few months, moreover, a series of scandals involving Chinese nationals -- including tax evasion, money-laundering and poaching endangered wildlife -- has soured locals on a foreign presence that can seem largely extractive: pulling uranium, timber, rhino horns and profits out the country without benefiting a population that, because of apartheid's legacy, ranks among the most unequal economically in the world. In January, a Windhoek newspaper captured the rising sentiment with an illustration on its front page of a golden dragon devouring the Namibian flag. The headline: ''Feeding Namibia to the Chinese.''\par \par \uc2 The question of how China is changing the world is often framed as a binary proposition: Is China the savior for developing nations, the only world power investing in their future -- or is this the dawn of a new colonial era? The question itself, however, is misleading. In Namibia, as in much of the rest of the world, the narratives live uncomfortably side by side, impossible to disentangle. ''You can argue that China is the best thing to happen to Africa -- or the worst,'' says Eric Olander, the co-host of the weekly ''China in Africa Podcast.'' ''The beauty is in the complexity.''\par \par \uc2 The sign on the lime green cement wall outside the restaurant, written in Chinese, read ''Ye Shanghai'': ''Shanghai Nights.'' Inside, the lunch crowd was already gone, but six middle-aged Chinese men and women -- including \uc2 James Shen\uc2  and his wife, Rose, the proprietors -- crowded around a table peeling prawns and sucking heartily on the shells. Nobody spoke. Blaring from the flat-screen television on the wall was a special report on CCTV-4, a channel from China's state television broadcaster, breathlessly describing the powers of the People's Liberation Army. When a double row of explosions erupted in the sea, Rose exclaimed, ''Wah, our China is so strong!''\par \par \uc2 The couple's restaurant is in Walvis Bay, a port surrounded on three sides by the Namib Desert, which some consider the oldest in the world. James and Rose are part of the early wave of Chinese immigrants who landed in Africa 20 years ago and never left. The Chinese diaspora has a long history of finding a foothold, and then thriving, in some of the world's most remote places: I've bumped into Chinese merchants everywhere from the Arctic tundra of Siberia to mining towns in the Andes. In Africa, entrepreneurs like James and Rose found a new frontier with the space, freedom and opportunities that many early settlers saw in the American West. ''My husband came to look at business here, and he fell in love with the wide-open spaces,'' Rose told me. ''But we're still Chinese first and foremost.''\par \par \uc2 Like many Chinese immigrants around the world, the couple began by opening a small mom-and-pop shop, filling the shelves with cheap clothes, shoes and bags shipped by container from China. Their store, James and Rose, still stands at a central intersection of Walvis Bay, even as their ventures have expanded to include a hotel, a restaurant, a karaoke bar, a massage parlor and a trading company. Today there are such Chinese-run stores in nearly every town in Namibia -- and thousands more across Africa.\par \par \uc2 On a recent Sunday in Windhoek's Chinatown, where dozens of shops occupy a series of long warehouses in the city's industrial district, Namibian families strolled the lanes, haggling over everything from knockoff Nikes and plastic children's toys to solar panels and secondhand mobile phones. One man told me he liked the low prices, even as he complained about the goods' poor quality -- and the harm they did to the local garment industry. Wu Qiaoxia, a Chinese entrepreneur whose real estate business began with a simple store in the northern town of Oshakati, waves off such criticism. ''Many Namibian children didn't even have shoes before we got here,'' Wu says. ''The people here needed everything, and we sold it to them, cheaply.''\par \par \uc2 One of the most influential Chinese immigrants in Namibia, Jack Huang, parlayed a small textile business into a mining, real estate and trade conglomerate. A backslapping 49-year-old native of Nantong, a city located about two hours northwest of Shanghai, Huang moved to Namibia nearly two decades ago. Early on, he helped transform Oshikango, a sleepy town on the Angolan border, into a raucous Chinese trading post anchored by his properties. Angolans made rich by a boom in oil production flooded in to buy things like stereos and S.U.V.s, paying with United States dollars or, at times, diamonds. The collapse of oil prices has turned Oshikango into a ghost town. But Huang, through his Sun Investment Group, has diversified into many lucrative businesses, including a mining venture that has identified other uranium deposits close to Husab.\par \par \uc2 Huang's success has come, in part, from cultivating connections with Namibia's political elite. Swapo, the guerrilla-group-turned-political-party, has dominated Namibia's elections since its independence -- the kind of stability that appeals to China's rulers and to entrepreneurs hoping to make long-lasting connections. Huang has referred to Sam Nujoma, Namibia's founding father, as ''my special adviser.'' During the 2014 election campaign, Huang and the Swapo candidate Hage Geingob (then the prime minister, now the president) attended a gala dinner at which, according to local reporting, the Chinese businessman pledged Geingob's political party a donation of 1 million Namibian dollars -- about $90,000. (Huang denies this.)\par \par \uc2 Huang's friends prefer to emphasize how much he has given back to his host country through his charity, the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. (Huang was out of the country at the time of my visit, but he authorized two deputies to speak with me on his behalf.) Over the last seven years, Huang's charity has awarded more than $2 million in scholarships to Namibian students to attend medical school in China (in Nantong, naturally). Some critics, however, claim that a few recipients of Huang's philanthropy were not needy students but children of the ruling elite. Last year, moreover, the local media revealed that before Geingob was elected president in 2014, Huang was the owner of a majority stake in a real estate venture whose only other shareholders are Geingob's family trust and ex-wife. The men tried to distance themselves from each other in the press, and Geingob professed to have no operational control of the company. Still, Huang's friends worry about his courting of the powerful. ''I kept warning Jack,'' says one businessman who occasionally socializes with Huang. '' 'Don't get too close to the fire. You'll burn your fingers.' ''\par \par \uc2 The exact number of Chinese living in Namibia remains the subject of contentious debate. No definitive data exist, and the constant ebb and flow of contract workers muddies the picture. Last fall, Namibia's home-affairs ministry raised alarms when it claimed that 100,000 Chinese nationals live in Namibia -- a figure that would be equivalent to 4 percent of the population. More conservative estimates run between 10,000 and 20,000. It is clear, however, that in Namibia and all across the developing world, the older generation of long-term immigrants is being eclipsed by China's new diaspora: younger, more educated workers going abroad to get experience -- and make a small fortune -- before returning to China. ''We were among the first ones here,'' Rose Shen says, ''but now there are Chinese everywhere.''\par \par \uc2 Sean Hao, a young telecommunications engineer in Windhoek, is part of that diaspora. Raised in a cave dwelling in central China's Shaanxi province, he wasn't expected to venture far beyond his village's orchard of jujube trees. But Hao was accepted by a university, a first for his family, and worked after graduation installing networks for a Chinese telecom giant. Renting a room for just $15 a month helped him squirrel away most of his $500 monthly salary, but his savings were hardly enough to buy the apartment he would need to marry. In a country where young men far outnumber women -- a legacy of the government's restrictive family-planning policy -- an apartment is seen as a prerequisite for attracting a wife and avoiding the fate of a ''bare branch'' (an unmarried person). But real estate seemed an impossible aspiration for a young man who grew up in a cave.\par \par \uc2 When a headhunter told Hao about a job in Africa that would pay more than $6,000 a month, Hao figured it was a swindle. ''I thought this must be a case of human trafficking,'' he remembers, laughing. The offer was real, but the job was in Nigeria, which he thought was unsafe. So Hao instead signed a contract to work on building the telecom system in Angola for more than $5,000 a month, more than 10 times his previous salary. After a year in Africa, Hao put a down payment on an apartment in Xi'an, a city in central China, and persuaded his girlfriend's parents that he was financially secure enough to marry their daughter. Hao and his wife soon had a baby girl, but his job in Africa meant that he saw her for only one month out of her first 15. ''She didn't even recognize me,'' he said. His wife and daughter joined him in his new posting in Namibia, but they lasted one lonely year before going home, leaving Hao stuck between his longing to be with his family in China and the opportunity to make money in Namibia.\par \par \uc2 On a warm Saturday night in late March, Hao joined a dozen Chinese colleagues under the thatched roofs of Joe's Beerhouse in Windhoek. Two of the men were headed back to China after finishing their short-term contracts, and the group was sending them off by knocking back pints of German-style lager. By the time I arrived at the bar, three men had already passed out, their heads planted on the table, and a few others were listing badly. Hao, the designated driver, had barely sipped any beer at all. Celebrating his colleagues' return to the motherland had put him in a contemplative mood. ''I'd like to go home, too,'' he said, ''but there are no jobs in China that could pay me even close to what I'm making now.''\par \par \uc2 In the hardscrabble hills of Sichuan Province, the parents of the uranium miner Dylan Teng still work as farmers, growing rice and maize in a hillside hamlet where most families share the same surname. Their village, called Tengjiayan (or Teng Family Rock), had only a primary school, so Teng left to study in nearby Guang'an, the birthplace of Deng Xiaoping, and then went on to college in China's northeast. It was a long road that was about to grow longer. ''I never thought I'd go abroad,'' he says, ''so I didn't even try in my English classes.''\par \par \uc2 In Teng's first job after graduation -- at the Beijing-based \uc2 Uranium Resources Company\uc2 , a C.G.N. subsidiary -- he learned about the company's mining interests in Kazakhstan, Australia and Namibia. The rural kid knew nothing about these foreign lands. But soon he was flying off to the most distant of the three to work in one of China's largest and most strategic mines. And one where C.G.N. was fully in control.\par \par \uc2 As a load-and-haul engineer at the Husab mine, Teng helps choreograph 26 gargantuan trucks whose wheels stand twice as tall as he does. So far, the trucks have hauled more than 100 million metric tons of rock out of Husab's open pits. As production increases this year, far more will be needed to process the 15 million pounds of uranium oxide that the mine aims to produce annually. ''The pressure is always on to stockpile enough so the processing plant never runs out of rock,'' Teng says.\par \par \uc2 To feed its hungry economy, China has worked frantically to secure enough resources to keep the juggernaut going. Besides oil and gas, which are a primary focus of its investments abroad, China's state-owned companies have gobbled up mines around the world: copper in Peru, nickel in Papua New Guinea, iron ore in Australia. In Africa, Chinese mining investments have increased 25-fold in just 10 years, from stakes in a handful of mines in 2006 to more than 120 in 2015.\par \par \uc2 As its economy has slowed recently and commodity prices have plunged, China has sharply reduced some of its imports, causing a few boom areas, like Western Australia, to go bust. Chinese mines in Zambia (copper) and South Africa (iron ore) have been forced to close. It might seem something of a miracle, then, that Husab runs at all. With uranium prices at less than half their level before the 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima (and less than a quarter of what they were in 2007), Namibia's two other active uranium operations have stopped digging up rock and process only already-stockpiled material. But Husab forges ahead, hiring many of the hundreds of workers laid off at those other mines. As one Namibian engineer who landed a job there after spending six months unemployed told me, ''Husab was my salvation.''\par \par \uc2 There is a simple reason that C.G.N. can afford to ramp up production at Husab: It is selling most of the uranium to itself, the Chinese state, so price is almost irrelevant. (Low prices, in fact, have enabled China both to stockpile uranium cheaply and to buy part of a struggling Namibian uranium mine, Langer-Heinrich.) An even bigger reason is China's ambition both to reduce its carbon emissions and to become a world leader in nuclear power.\par \par \uc2 Nearly 88 percent of China's energy now comes from fossil fuels, only 1 percent from nuclear power. (Solar, wind and hydropower account for the remaining 11 percent.) To reach its clean-energy goals -- and shed the ignominious title of world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases -- China has put nuclear power back on an almost impossibly fast track. The country now has 37 nuclear reactors, with another 20 under construction, and it aims to have 110 reactors by 2030. (Beyond that, the goal is to become an exporter of nuclear-reactor technology. China has already built six reactors overseas, and last month, Swakop Uranium, a C.G.N. subsidiary, submitted a proposal to construct a reactor in Namibia.)\par \par \uc2 This rate of growth, six new plants each year, would catapult China past the United States as the world's top nuclear power, but it also raises concerns. In January, an American consultant to C.G.N. pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to illegally recruit United States nuclear engineers to help accelerate the design and manufacture of C.G.N. reactor components. Critics at home and abroad also question whether China's safety standards can keep pace with the new reactors. One Chinese physicist, He Zuoxiu, even told \uc2 The Guardian\uc2  that the plan is ''insane.''\par \par \uc2 C.G.N. did not allow me to visit the mine or interview its managers, claiming that they were too busy increasing production. To get a glimpse of the vast complex, I drove down a dusty back road to the highland plain where the Welwitschia mirabilis grow, near Husab's back gate. Before construction began at Husab in 2013, the company transplanted four rare Welwitschia specimens that would have been destroyed in the blasts -- a symbolic gesture in a country that reveres the ancient plant. Since then, C.G.N. has seemed eager to dispel the uncaring reputation that Chinese state-owned companies have earned: It has made donations to drought victims, offered scholarships to local engineering students and, in a first for a Chinese company in Namibia, even invited a local labor union to set up shop at the mine site.\par \par \uc2 Independent unions are essentially illegal in China. And the Metal and Allied Namibian Workers Union had waged a campaign against Chinese state-owned companies, accusing some of paying Namibian workers only one-third of the minimum wage and others of using armies of Chinese workers for unskilled jobs that by law should go to Namibians. So when C.G.N. invited the union's secretary general, Justina Jonas, to China for the mine's inaugural event, she was skeptical. ''The Chinese will promise you heaven,'' she told me, ''but the implementation can be hell.'' Jonas threatened not to go to China if Husab didn't sign a project labor agreement protecting workers' wages, hours and safety. Just days before the trip, C.G.N. signed the agreement, a first for a Chinese company.\par \par \uc2 For all its public outreach, Husab still operates in a self-contained Chinese universe. Chinese managers often schedule key meetings for the weekend, when it's convenient for them to review and plan -- but also when Namibian colleagues are not present, according to local employees. Local workers marvel at how, when a non-Chinese part breaks down, Chinese engineers will sometimes send the specs home so Chinese companies can reverse-engineer replacement parts at a fraction of the cost. This looks different from a Chinese perspective: Just as the mine offers young engineers an opportunity to hone their expertise in vital new jobs, it also gives Chinese companies a chance to show that they can make high-quality vehicles and equipment -- at a third of the cost of top foreign brands. Husab still makes companies go through testing and bidding, but as one worker put it: ''We have to help and support our brother companies. It's all part of the 'going out' policy.''\par \par \uc2 Mining is hardly China's only interest in Namibia. The land is too arid to sustain the kinds of vast agricultural projects underway in Mozambique and Brazil. But China's state-owned construction companies are burning up their excess capacity building Namibian highways and ports, a Chinese embassy compound and a new military academy in Okahandja. Military relations are close, too. China trains Namibian officers -- an echo of its 1960s assistance to Swapo -- and supplies weapons. In April, the United States intervened to stop Namibia from paying $12 million to Poly Technologies, a subsidiary of a Chinese company on the American sanctions list for selling banned weapons to Iran, Syria and North Korea. It was a reminder that the United States is still in the background, warily watching China's incursion into Africa.\par \par \uc2 Husab is a tangible, direct investment, but most Chinese projects in Namibia and around the world are financed by soft loans that carry risks. Last year, China established a new $60 billion fund to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, mostly with Chinese lending. The easy money is alluring, and the projects can be essential. But most of the loans stipulate that a Chinese state-owned company must take the lead, ensuring that the work, skills and profits are kept largely in the Chinese family. Countries like Namibia are left holding the debt. Schlettwein, the finance minister, told me, ''I don't think those are real investments, but opportunities latched onto by Chinese enterprises without really adding value to the Namibian economy.''\par \par \uc2 Such criticism irritates Chinese business owners and diplomats, who point out that Chinese companies have invested more than $5 billion in Namibia and now employ more than 6,000 Namibians. ''We're here to do business on an equal footing with the locals,'' says Xia Lili, the former diplomat who is deputy general manager of Jack Huang's Sun Investment Group and secretary general of the Namibia-China Loving Heart Organization. ''We bring in money to establish mines and factories. Who benefits? The Namibians. Did the Western powers ever do this? Not nearly as much. So this talk of new colonialism is untrue.''\par \par \uc2 Namibia, though, is starting to push back. Last year the government pulled out of a $570 million loan agreement with a state-owned Chinese company to expand the Windhoek airport. Then in September, as sluggish growth and other foreign loans pushed Namibia's debt to over 40 percent of its G.D.P., the government suspended all new loan tenders. Schlettwein says the freeze was a prudent act of belt-tightening, not a move specifically targeting China. Nevertheless, he says: ''It sends out a signal that Namibian interests are not to be trampled on indiscriminately. It sends a signal that our relationship must mature.''\par \par \uc2 One morning in late December, the Namibian conservation biologist Chris Brown was working alone in his Windhoek office when he heard a banging at the gate. Rushing out, he found two angry Chinese men in button-down shirts: the first and second secretaries from the Chinese Embassy. One of them threw a crumpled letter through the gate, Brown says, and shouted: ''These are lies! You are making China look bad in the eyes of the world!''\par \par \uc2 The pages were the same ones Brown hand-delivered to the Chinese Embassy two days before -- and then sent to other diplomatic missions, media outlets and international organizations. Signed by 45 local environmental groups, including Brown's own Namibian Chamber of \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , the letter blamed Chinese nationals for a sharp surge in the commercial poaching of wildlife in Namibia -- and excoriated the embassy for doing little to stop it.\par \par \uc2 Over the last two years, Namibia has lost nearly 200 elephants and endangered rhinos to poaching. In November, a Chinese smuggler was caught in the Johannesburg airport with 18 rhino horns -- all from Namibia. Two months earlier, four Chinese men were sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to smuggle out 14 rhino horns in 2014. (Rhino-horn powder is an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine that is believed to strengthen the immune system.) Brown had meant the letter to provoke a response, but this visit was unexpected.\par \par \uc2 ''You are abusing China's good nature,'' one of the diplomats said, in a raised voice, according to Brown. ''Only a handful of Chinese have been involved in poaching.''\par \par \uc2 ''No, Chinese demand is driving all of this,'' Brown replied. ''I think you are trying to strip all of our resources for China.''When the yelling subsided, Brown says, he invited the men inside. Sitting in his conference room, they leafed through binders filled with photographs of slaughtered rhinos and elephants. ''They got quieter and quieter,'' Brown recalls. A few days later, he met with the Chinese ambassador, who cautioned him against letting a few ''rotten apples'' tarnish the entire Chinese community. Brown again insisted it was a more systemic problem. ''Listen, we can ratchet up the pressure and make things even worse for you,'' he says he argued. ''Or we can come together to solve this problem.'' The ambassador, he says, agreed to join the antipoaching fight.\par \par \uc2 One of the most troubling dimensions of China's global expansion is its reputation for pillaging and pilfering the natural world. China is not the only culprit in the $19 billion illegal wildlife trade. But its growing hunger for the rare, exotic and dubiously curative is devastating worldwide populations of rhinos and elephants, sharks and tigers -- and spurring illegal timber operations in rain forests stretching from Congo to Cambodia. Huang Hongxiang, a former journalist from China who investigated ivory and rhino-horn poaching in Namibia, has started a Kenya-based nonprofit organization, China House, to help Chinese companies and communities engage in wildlife conservation as a form of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 . ''In a lot of global environmental issues, Chinese are part of the problem,'' he says, ''so they have to be part of the solution.''\par \par \uc2 Poaching is a scourge in Damaraland, an arid region of rocky outcroppings in northwest Namibia. ''Locals are enticed into killing rhinos by the China market,'' my Namibian guide, Taffy, who tracks elephants and rhinos, told me. ''The horns always seem to end up in Chinese hands.'' In the past, conservation issues were mostly championed by white Namibians. That is changing. ''Blacks used to think whites cared more about the animals than them,'' says Shinovene Immanuel, a reporter at The Namibian. ''But now that poaching has gotten out of hand, everybody is upset.''\par \par \uc2 Public anger is also rising over some Chinese business proposals that could do damage to the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . One Chinese-owned company has sought to clear-cut part of Namibia's only pristine forest, in the Zambezi region, to create a tobacco plantation nearly double the size of Manhattan, despite the fact that the area's sandy soil is unsuitable. Another Chinese business wants to set up donkey abattoirs to meet China's soaring demand for donkey meat and skin (the latter is considered a curative in Chinese medicine). And a Namibia-based Chinese company filed a request last fall to capture killer whales, penguins, dolphins and sharks in Namibian waters -- all to sell to aquatic theme parks in China. Local activists protested for weeks until the Chinese firm withdrew its proposal.\par \par \uc2 Three months after Brown's letter provoked the indignant response, the Chinese Embassy hosted a much more diplomatic meeting of Namibian activists and some 60 Chinese business leaders. Besides trumpeting China's recent ban on all ivory sales -- and airing an antipoaching video featuring the basketball star \uc2 Yao Ming\uc2  -- the acting ambassador, Li Nan, denounced poaching and lectured Chinese nationals about obeying Namibian law. Li told me in an email that, at Brown's invitation, he will visit the rhinos' habitat in northern Namibia this month. The two countries, he said, are also working to form a joint law-enforcement task force to combat transnational wildlife criminals.\par \par \uc2 Jack Huang also spoke out against poaching, but a different kind of dragnet was closing around him. On Feb. 1, the tycoon and four others (three of them Chinese) were arrested at Windhoek's international airport for their participation in a supposed tax-fraud scheme that netted nearly $300 million -- the largest case in Namibian history. The arrests were part of a two-year investigation into more than 30 Chinese companies accused of concealing illegal earnings. While in custody, Huang reportedly tried to contact President Geingob, but his business partner refused to help. ''When my 'friend' was arrested and spent a night in jail, there was no interference or intervention,'' Geingob told a local paper later. ''This is because in Namibia, we uphold the rule of law, the separation of powers, and pride ourselves on the total independence of our judiciary.''\par \par \uc2 Huang, the man with all the connections, now finds himself disconnected. In mid-February, soon after his release on $75,000 bail, he claimed that the tax-fraud case against him was based on outdated information. Xia, his deputy at Sun Investment, told me that Huang actually divested from Golden Phoenix, a company named in the case, more than eight years ago, but that the transaction had not been entered into the official computer system. When this trial is over, Huang may file lawsuits against those who attacked his businesses, Xia says. In the meantime, the gregarious entrepreneur will probably spend more time dining alone. When he invited an old friend out to dinner recently, he was gently rebuffed -- the power broker was suddenly a pariah.\par \par \uc2 Arresting a high-flying Chinese businessman may be a simple matter of law, but it is also one more sign of how the relationship between Namibia and China is being recalibrated. Li Nan wrote to me that he believes that the boisterous local press is ''trying to whip up racist sentiments and hatred.'' The animosity in Namibia, though, is nowhere near the levels that have caused explosive riots at a Chinese coal mine in Zambia, including one in 2012 that left a Chinese manager dead, or that sparked unruly protests against Chinese traders in Kampala, Uganda, last month. (The rising resentment toward the Chinese in Uganda recalls another era, when the dictator Idi Amin expelled an earlier wave of immigrant merchants, from the Indian diaspora, in 1972.)\par \par \uc2 Still, the new tensions between China and Namibia are laid bare at police checkpoints around the country, where Chinese nationals are routinely singled out for inspection. The police say this new policy has already exposed several cases of wildlife smuggling. Jack Huang's associate, Xia, was pulled over at the checkpoint on the airport road last month. The police frisked him, combed through his luggage and scoured his car. ''All the while they were yelling, 'Rhino horn, rhino horn, where's the rhino horn?' '' Xia recalls. ''I was shocked that this could happen in Namibia. This is a country that is supposed to be our all-weather friend.''\par \par \uc2 As the afternoon sun weakens over the Husab Uranium Mine, most of the 2,000 or so Namibian workers return to their desert barracks. Teng and the other Chinese engineers board buses for the ride back through the moonscape to Swakopmund and the little house on Amathila Avenue. After sharing another Chinese meal together, the men disperse. Teng walks back to his apartment, where he will spend a few hours on his computer doing administrative and supervisory tasks. ''Our real secret,'' Teng says, ''is that we work 12-hour days while everybody else works eight.''\par \par \uc2 It's a chilly Saturday in April -- the antipodal winter is coming -- and Teng has worked overtime again. He has missed one of the only diversions here: Saturday-afternoon basketball games at the local sports center. (China now has so many state-owned companies in Namibia that they stage an annual 15-team championship; China Harbour Engineering, the port builder in Walvis Bay, won this year.) Strolling on the Swakopmund waterfront, Teng was no longer clad in his khaki mining uniform. Wearing jeans and a Quiksilver T-shirt and cradling a cappuccino, he looked like any tourist gazing out over the crashing Atlantic surf. During his nearly four years here, Teng has not had too many chances to be a tourist, though he took advantage of a recent holiday to go on a wildlife tour in Etosha National Park.\par \par \uc2 In their bubble at Husab, Teng and his colleagues are mostly insulated from the tensions between China and Namibia. These huge Chinese projects all over the developing world can seem like spaceships landing on distant planets. Chinese workers often have little incentive -- or latitude -- to venture out into the alien \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , especially when the state-owned mother ship provides food, lodging and transport. And the exhausting work can sap them of all curiosity about their surroundings. On a plane back to China in April, I sat next to a worker who had just spent two years in Equatorial Guinea -- but had no idea where it was.\par \par \uc2 The tech-savvy Teng, by contrast, can pinpoint his exact location on Google Earth, even though his routine is largely circumscribed by the 43-mile route between Husab and Swakopmund. Saving more in Namibia than he could back in China -- thanks, in part, to all those free meals on Amathila Avenue -- Teng has built a tidy nest egg. In 2014, when a C.G.N. delegation from China visited Husab, Teng chatted with one of the two women in the group. Online flirting ensued. In January, Teng stunned his Husab colleagues when he returned from a trip to China with a ring on his finger. He'd married the visitor -- mission accomplished -- joining a handful of others who had done the same thing. Teng's other goal has not yet been achieved. He wants to see Husab reach its full potential next year, fueling China's continued rise. ''This is an important thing for China, '' he says, ''and I want to be a part of it.''\par \par \uc2 The Chinese migrants who have gone out into the world, the risk-takers who have found spots in Asia, Latin America and Africa, are as diverse as China itself: young and middle-aged, unschooled and highly educated, working for private companies and state-owned enterprises -- and even for themselves. They are not a monolith. And yet, in these far-off places, they are connected to one another in a way that they never could be back home in a land of 1.4 billion people. It's not just the shared food, culture or language -- or the solidarity that comes from being thrown together in a harsh \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . What binds these individuals together is an abiding belief that their presence overseas is making China better and stronger. This shared conviction, as much as the state that has nurtured it, is what makes China a colossus, a nation that can be seen by others, in the same instant, as a blessing and a curse.\par \par \uc2 Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  delivered to your inbox every week.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RF\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Brook Larmer is a contributing writer for the magazine.

What does the press have wrong and right about 3G and why?\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 AB At 3G, we are owners of great businesses and brands and our goal is to grow them. We are also promoters of people, and we believe that we attract best-in-class talent because of our long-term focus. We\u8217\'20\'19ve been building businesses for over four decades. We dream big.\par \par \uc2 While we are known for being efficient operators, focusing only on our ability to drive efficiencies overlooks several important aspects of our approach.\par \par \uc2 We are owner-operators first and foremost, as our owners are the individuals directly responsible for operating our companies. Everyone at 3G has considerable skin in the game, which creates powerful incentives to do what is right for the long term. We are fortunate to be differentiated in this sense, as we are not moved by some of the short-term pressures typically felt by other groups. We want to own these companies forever. This gives us the luxury of maintaining a very disciplined approach to each one of our businesses, as we are able to identify and own companies only once we are entirely satisfied that they are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth and successful brand building. A clear example of our long-term orientation is \uc2 Anheuser-Busch InBev\uc2 , of which partners of the firm have been meaningful owners since 1989.\par \par \uc2 Most importantly, our greatest resource is our people. At the core of our operating involvement, is the creation and committed implementation of an ownership culture. Our culture of ownership leads to responsible stewardship of capital and resources at all levels of our organisations, and manifests itself in every business decision we make. We find that this culture is perfect for those who thrive in a performance-driven \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , which is why we are able to consistently attract and develop great talent.\par \par \uc2 We build brands. We aggressively reinvest in our product innovation, expansion into global white spaces and brand health. We know that world-class brand reputations take decades to build and only hours or even minutes to lose. We are the stewards of our brands and businesses and are cognisant of that in everything that we do.\par \par \uc2 FT What\u8217\'20\'19s the hardest area of a company\u8217\'20\'19s overheads in which to cut costs and why? How do you achieve those reductions and ensure they don\u8217\'20\'19t rise again? Please give concrete examples.\par \par \uc2 AB We are incredibly focused on finding the most efficient way to do things, and we treat every expenditure as if it was our own personal expense. Our view is that every area of an organisation has opportunities to improve efficiency and no expense is off-limits. In summary, we don\u8217\'20\'19t like to spend unnecessary dollars that don\u8217\'20\'19t directly help our consumer or customers. But it\u8217\'20\'19s not about which departments or areas. It is about finding the right balance of expense reduction and investment.\par \par \uc2 That said, only a very small percentage of our time is devoted to identifying cost opportunities. We believe deeply in incentives and because of that, the vast majority of our energy \u8212\'20\'14 and the vast majority of our employees\u8217\'20\'19 performance targets \u8212\'20\'14 is linked directly to growth. This is true across all of our businesses, brands, categories and geographies. We set goals based on what is going to create the most long-term value, and invariably that ends up being growth.\par \par \uc2 FT Shareholders love you but many of the people working in the companies you acquire do not. People we spoke to described 3G as lacking moral values and an appreciation for the communities working in, and around, their factories. As one put it recently: \u8220\'20\'1CThey come in and they just start getting rid of people.\u8221\'20\'1D What is your response please and how do you view the issue of the human toll of job cuts? Is economic value created \u8212\'20\'14 or is it all about shareholders?\par \par \uc2 AB There is no one corporate culture that appeals universally to everyone and we are by no means an exception to that. Having said that, I wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t agree with the characterisation in the question. Meritocracy is a core pillar of our management philosophy. We enable our people to carve their own path by providing attractive opportunities where they typically gain access to responsibilities and compensation levels much sooner in their careers than they typically would anywhere else. We do make challenging decisions every day as we operate our businesses in the most efficient manner to ensure long-term sustainability and growth, and we carefully consider the implications and effect on the communities in which we operate.\par \par \uc2 We place extremely high value on good corporate citizenship and we treat our people with the utmost respect and dignity. That also includes respecting and being generous with regards to any pre-existing compensation and severance arrangements. We run our businesses the right way, every day. Ultimately, we make decisions based on the benefit conferred to our people and businesses in the long term, even when those decisions may be difficult in the short term.\par \par \uc2 We also believe in giving back to the people and communities we serve. As just one example, at Kraft Heinz the company supports hundreds of non-profit and philanthropic organisations. It recently committed to investing $200m in Growing a Better World through its \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  initiatives, and we recently announced that the company will donate 1bn nutritious meals to people in need over the next five years.\par \par \uc2 At \uc2 Restaurant Brands International\uc2  (RBI), in 2016 alone the \uc2 Tim Hortons\uc2  system raised an all-time record of C$12.6m for the Tim Hortons Children\u8217\'20\'19s Foundation through the brand\u8217\'20\'19s annual Camp Day, and the \uc2 Burger King\uc2  system raised $5.9m for the Burger King McLamore Foundation, of which approximately $3m in scholarships was awarded to nearly 2,800 students.\par \par \uc2 FT Do you see the current political \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  of the administration of US President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s sharp focus on jobs as a potential brake on your ability to cut jobs in your next acquisitions? Do you think there could be a backlash?\par \par \uc2 AB With respect to jobs, we take great pride in the fact that since 3G acquired \uc2 Burger King\uc2  in 2010, the BK system has created over 105,000 jobs around the world by increasing net restaurant count by over 3,500 stores. This job growth is a byproduct of growing the business approximately five times faster than prior to our ownership, and we look to continue this trend across our companies.\par \par \uc2 3G\u8217\'20\'19s strategy is to identify and own companies that are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth and success, and the US continues to be a fantastic place to find these types of opportunities whenever it makes good strategic sense. As always, our focus on long-term growth will continue, with or without another acquisition but, in all contexts, we work collaboratively with all stakeholders, including government agencies and officials as we have done for decades.\par \par \uc2 FT 3G has shown repeatedly that it can improve profitability sharply at companies it acquires. But it cannot demonstrate a similar trend with regard to like-for-like organic revenue growth. Why is this?\par \par \uc2 AB Our objective is always to achieve long-term profitable growth, and there are plenty of examples of this across our companies.\par \par \uc2 Look at RBI. By putting a strategy in place at \uc2 Burger King\uc2  focused on menu, marketing, image and operations, we were able to grow sales per restaurant in the US from approximately $1.1m to over $1.3m from 2011 to 2016, which translates into pretty much doubling operating profit per restaurant for our franchisees.\par \par \uc2 We have also accelerated the pace of growth since acquiring the company in late 2010 to make \uc2 Burger King\uc2  one of the fastest-growing restaurant brands in the world. Under 3G\u8217\'20\'19s ownership, net restaurant growth accelerated from approximately 170 restaurants per year in 2010 to 735 restaurants per year in 2016, representing a 4.2 times increase. We accelerated this pace of growth by pioneering the Master Franchise Joint Venture model where we have partners with great entrepreneurs in places like Brazil, Russia and China. Back in 2010, \uc2 Burger King\uc2  had approximately 150 restaurants in those three countries and this past year we crossed over 1,650 restaurants in these countries. We also are pleased to have recently announced the first agreements under such a model for the \uc2 Tim Hortons\uc2  brand as well, having signed master franchise joint ventures in each of the Philippines, Great Britain, and Mexico in the last year.\par \par \uc2 At Kraft Heinz, after a year of significant transformation, we ended 2016 with positive organic net sales growth of 0.3 per cent, which is in line with the peer average of 0.4 per cent. The positive organic performance in 2016 is a trend improvement versus the previous couple of years, in which Kraft Heinz eliminated underperforming stock keeping units and negative-return promotions, in order to generate more funds to reinvest behind the business. We intend to drive continued improvement in our organic sales growth over time.\par \par \uc2 With regard to \uc2 AB InBev\uc2 , the company has been savvy about expanding into new regions and capitalising on the strength and global reach of its brands. For instance, Budweiser is consumed in 85 countries and is measured by BrandZ as the world\u8217\'20\'19s most valuable beer brand. It has double or triple-digit growth in more than 15 countries. As an example, the company was able to successfully introduce the Budweiser brand to China and, in the process, created the number one beer in that country. Total volumes of the Budweiser brand worldwide are up approximately 30 per cent since \uc2 InBev\uc2  acquired \uc2 Anheuser Busch\uc2  in December of 2008, despite challenging trends in its core markets and declining market shares prior to the combination.\par \par \uc2 Examples like these exist throughout the businesses, which is why we are extremely confident in the future growth of our companies.\par \par \uc2 FT 3G has undoubtedly had an enormous impact on the food and beverage industry, but corporate longevity and legacy stem from inventing new products that consumers can\u8217\'20\'19t get enough of. Disruption in the industry is coming from new and smart companies, not the mature/older ones you invest in. Is 3G\u8217\'20\'19s legacy going to end up being its specialised application of zero-based budgeting?\par \par \uc2 AB 3G has long been a proponent of ZBB [zero-based budgeting], in which every employee at every level of our company makes financial decisions as if they were spending their own money. ZBB is not simply a cost-cutting measure. It\u8217\'20\'19s a daily mindset that is resistant to complacency and promotes responsible stewardship of our resources.\par \par \uc2 But instead of focusing on what will define our legacy, we simply focus on what we do best: maximising business potential by investing in people and brands.\par \par \uc2 RBI, for example, has consistently experienced impressive same-store sales growth and restaurant growth since the 3G-led turnround. This type of growth does not happen without continually offering innovative choices to our customers.\par \par \uc2 Focusing specifically on \uc2 Burger King\uc2 , we differentiate ourselves not only by flame-grilling our burgers and through our groundbreaking advertising campaigns. Just weeks ago, \uc2 Burger King\uc2  was awarded Marketer of the Year by the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Some our creative marketing campaigns that contributed to this award include the McWhopper Proposal, #WhoIsTheKing, King Games and Subservient Chicken.\par \par \uc2 We have also \uc2 applied innovation\uc2  to our product platforms, an example of which would be our Chicken Fries at \uc2 Burger King\uc2 . We have rolled out several limited-time Chicken Fries offerings such as Cheetos Chicken Fries and Jalape\u241\'00\'F1o Chicken Fries, each of which have given our guests further reasons to revisit our restaurants. At \uc2 Tim Hortons\uc2 , we recently announced the rollout of a new espresso-based beverage platform (through the implementation of new espresso machines that freshly grind coffee beans and steamed real Canadian milk) in Canada to extend our \u8220\'20\'1Ccoffee authority\u8221\'20\'1D status in brewed coffee to espresso-based coffee.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, back in 2015 we acqui-hired a team of engineers who formed \u8220\'20\'1CRBI Digital,\u8221\'20\'1D which has been working hard to roll out digital technology that enhances our guests\u8217\'20\'19 experiences with our brands. They are currently beta testing new digital apps with functionality such as pre-order and pre-pay. These apps will meaningfully enhance the experience of how guests interact with our restaurants. We anticipate rolling out these apps later this year and are excited by the great progress our RBI Digital team has made in such a short timeframe.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s another example from Kraft Heinz. Heinz, a brand that\u8217\'20\'19s almost 150 years old, has grown 12 per cent at retail in the US since 2014 thanks to innovations in Heinz Ketchup and successfully extending the Heinz brand into new retail categories. We have also introduced iconic, century-old brands like Kraft Mac & Cheese and Planters to millions of new consumers around the world. Of note, since the merger, Kraft Heinz has focused its marketing efforts on working media that effectively reach and benefit consumers. In fact, the company increased its working media spend in the US by nearly $100m over the past two years.\par \par \uc2 All of our companies are constantly adjusting to changes, including new consumer demands and evolving technology. We constantly aim to stay ahead of these changes, and we believe we have best-in-class innovators across our businesses to tackle these challenges.\par \par \uc2 FT 3G\u8217\'20\'19s value creation comes from making ever-larger acquisitions at regular and repeated intervals with the bulk of returns coming through the consolidation, synergies and cost-cuts of the first few years. Cheap debt plays a big role in this. Do you agree that this is a different business model from that of traditional companies? Why continue with the serial M&A otherwise? A different way of looking at this question is the argument that the 3G cost-cutting model works in relation to mature, low-growth businesses \u8212\'20\'14 but not ones with high-growth potential because they require more investment.\par \par \uc2 AB The question mischaracterises our approach to ownership. The core of our strategy is to identify and own companies that are well-positioned for profitable, long-term growth, the bulk of it coming organically. Value creation doesn\u8217\'20\'19t just come from acquisitions, and indeed, acquisitions are not our focus.\par \par \uc2 For example, we have accelerated the pace of growth since acquiring \uc2 Burger King\uc2  in late 2010 to make it one of the fastest growing restaurant brands in the world. As a part of our image focus within our \u8220\'20\'1Cfour pillar\u8221\'20\'1D strategy under 3G\u8217\'20\'19s leadership, we and our franchisees invested meaningfully in restaurant remodels, developed a unified global brand image and went from having approximately 20 per cent to approximately 70 per cent of system restaurants under a modern image, vastly improving our guests\u8217\'20\'19 experience.\par \par \uc2 FT What happens when the M&A opportunities run out and how far off that point is 3G? In beer, the model has already reached its limit in terms of large-scale M&A. Sceptics say that without large-scale M&A, the model is doomed to failure (or at best 3G will then face the same growth difficulties as the rest of the industry). What is your response please? In any case, is there not a limit to how big a company can become, without becoming unmanageable?\par \par \uc2 AB We are long-term owners with a near-infinite time horizon, very unlike the typical private equity model. Our model does not rely on M&A. In building efficient companies through a culture of meritocracy and ownership, we free up capital to reinvest aggressively behind our brands and businesses. Product innovation and effective marketing are central pillars of our strategy, and serve as growth drivers at companies like RBI and Kraft Heinz.\par \par \uc2 FT So far the beer business has been kept separate from 3G Capital investments. Might that change in the future? What would future possibilities for co-operation between the beer, food and fast food companies you control look like? If not, why not?\par \par \uc2 AB The businesses in which 3G Capital and its partners invest execute their respective goals and strategies independent of each other. They operate as individual entities with clear priorities to grow their world-class brands. And they do this through focused investments that leverage their innovation capabilities, global reach and consumer-first approach.\par \par \uc2 FT 3G folks hadn\u8217\'20\'19t failed in a bid to take over a company before the aborted \uc2 Unilever\uc2  attempt. What went wrong and what are the biggest lessons you\u8217\'20\'19ve taken away from that experience? If news of KHC\u8217\'20\'19s approach of \uc2 Unilever\uc2  hadn\u8217\'20\'19t leaked do you think you would have had a better chance to convince \uc2 Unilever\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s board about the merits of the deal? Since \uc2 Warren Buffett\uc2  wants only friendly deals, does this limit the scope of dealmaking with him in the future? How reliant is 3G on Mr Buffett and his \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  group for financing future deals?\par \par \uc2 AB The chances of any large-scale M&A deal getting to completion are by definition always slim, so we are fortunate to have been able to complete successfully so many transactions involving iconic and global brands in the past few years.\par \par \uc2 Our interest in \uc2 Unilever\uc2  was unfortunately made public at an exceptionally early stage and, under UK takeover rules, we were required to disclose our initial approach. We and \uc2 Berkshire Hathaway\uc2  had agreed from the outset that our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis only. As it became clear that \uc2 Unilever\uc2  did not wish to pursue a transaction, we withdrew the offer. We respect \uc2 Unilever\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s culture, strategy and leadership, and we wish \uc2 Unilever\uc2  the best of luck in the future.\par \par \uc2 We have a proven track-record of creating significant value for the shareholders of companies that have recently merged with ours. Recent examples include total appreciation of approximately 90 per cent for Kraft shareholders since mid-2015 merger with Heinz that created Kraft Heinz, and approximately 160 per cent total appreciation for Tim Horton\u8217\'20\'19s shareholders since the December 2014 merger with \uc2 Burger King\uc2  that created \uc2 Restaurant Brands International\uc2 . Therefore we don\u8217\'20\'19t need to go anywhere that we are not welcome by shareholders in order to do a deal.\par \par \uc2 FT Before you made an attempt to acquire \uc2 Unilever\uc2  with Kraft Heinz, there was a lot of talk about 3G \u8220\'20\'1Csetting up a new platform\u8221\'20\'1D to build from scratch. Is this new platform personal care and household goods? Is it still the new platform you wish to develop?\par \par \uc2 AB We will always evaluate any opportunity that makes sense for our investors, our consumers and our brands \u8212\'20\'14 within our existing portfolio or as a new platform.\par \par \uc2 FT Following the failure to acquire \uc2 Unilever\uc2 , should we expect KHC\u8217\'20\'19s priority for an acquisition to be 1) markets outside the US; 2) in the US; 3) or even to try and grow independently?\par \par \uc2 AB Kraft Heinz doesn\u8217\'20\'19t need another acquisition to drive profitable growth for the long term. The company has a world-class portfolio that can travel and has a lot of whitespace in front of it. Right now, the company is focused on building great brands that consumers love and on developing top talent who can lead these brands into the future.\par \par \uc2 As always, we will evaluate any opportunity that makes strategic sense, always with the objective of growing for the long term, whether in the US or internationally.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 anhsrb : \uc2 Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc | thgcp : \uc2 3G Capital Management LLC | artboe : \uc2 Anheuser-Busch InBev\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 i661 : \uc2 Restaurants/Cafes/Fast Food Places | i66 : \uc2 Hotels/Restaurants | ilea : \uc2 Leisure/Arts/Hospitality | i41 : \uc2 Food/Beverages/Tobacco | i427 : \uc2 Brewing | ialco : \uc2 Alcoholic Beverages/Drinks | ibevrge : \uc2 Beverages/Drinks | icnp : \uc2 Consumer Goods | ifinal : \uc2 Financial Services | iinv : \uc2 Investing/Securities\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 The Financial Times Limited (AAIW/EIW)\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document FTCOM00020170507ed57003h1\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw254\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3810\pichgoal600

On the map, the region is a fat green stripe, indicating two national parks end to end. But the water, as I trail my fingers in the warm bath, is tawny brown. It is carrying way too much sediment: acres of dirt washed down by the deforestation that's making way for cattle ranches along the supposedly protected banks, and tons more dumped by construction on a massive hydroelectric dam a day's voyage upstream.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Both are existential threats to this place and its people. And both are products of the pervasive and sophisticated corruption that characterizes the Honduran government.\par \par \uc2 I have spent a decade living through and researching how corruption has helped fuel some of the world's most significant security crises - from the expansion of violent extremism to revolutions and their bloody aftermaths. Last year, I began wondering if similar links exist between corruption and another grave threat: environmental devastation. It didn't take long to find them.\par \par \uc2 Corruption, in this context, should not be understood as merely the opportunistic lapses of an underpaid game warden or a customs agent who looks the other way in exchange for an envelope. Rather, in Honduras and more than 60 other countries worldwide, senior officials, key business leaders and out-and-out criminals weave themselves into sophisticated networks for the purpose of maximizing personal gains. Natural resources are a principal source of the cash these kleptocrats capture.\par \par \uc2 One of the most lucrative rackets is oil. Nigeria's national oil company, to pick an egregious example, could not account for nearly $20 billion in revenue from 2012 and 2013 alone. A byproduct of such looting - and the predatory attitudes it engenders - is the oil-soaked Niger Delta. The once-vibrant web of winding creeks and inlets is black with sludge, its mangroves gone, grasses and palm trees reduced to tar-smeared stumps. People who once navigated their slender-bowed boats and swam, fished and gathered shellfish there now find an oily sheen in their well water. They suffer skin and lung ailments.\par \par \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  admits to more than 1,800 spills there in the past decade. In January 2015, \uc2 Shell\uc2  agreed to pay $84 million to settle a lawsuit about just two of these. Meanwhile, according to \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2 , Nigeria's National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency continues to certify visibly filthy areas as clean.\par \par \uc2 This pattern is consistent across the corrupt countries I have studied: Agencies charged with protecting the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  are rendered functionally inoperative - budgets are slashed, staff is short or demotivated, equipment goes missing. Predatory extraction of natural resources for personal gain requires lax enforcement of whatever regulations exist. In Nigeria's case, the predators aren't just the huge oil multinationals, whose behavior may be encouraged by the ambiguous nature of many of their dealings with officials they know are corrupt, but also host-country operators and outright thieves, who often work in partnership with government institutions. When they see the magnitude of the theft at the top of the pyramid, they consider themselves entitled.\par \par \uc2 In countries that lack hydrocarbons, other natural resources substitute. The investigative charity \uc2 Global Witness\uc2  has documented the Cambodian ruling clique's control of an illegal logging syndicate that is stripping the country of its tropical forest.\par \par \uc2 The United States obviously does not fall into the same category as Nigeria or Cambodia when it comes to corruption. Still, certain trends should alarm Americans. Consider West Virginia, where, in 2004, the chief executive of Massey Energy smeared a judge and bankrolled the campaign of a previously unknown judicial rival, who, once elected, ruled favorably on cases affecting the coal company - including at least one the company had lost in a jury trial. Judge Brent Benjamin argued that there was no basis for presuming that the $3 million Massey spent on his campaign might affect his impartiality.\par \par \uc2 This is the same Massey executive who was sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to violate mine safety rules in a 2010 explosion that killed 29 miners. Over the years, Massey has taken advantage of the lax enforcement guaranteed by the coal industry's hold over West Virginia politics, not just to repeatedly ignore health and safety requirements, but also to decapitate forested mountains and routinely dump rubble, slurry and wastewater into the state's rivers.\par \par \uc2 Another conduit for corruption: dams. Brazil's sprawling corruption scandal has implicated several mega-dams in the Amazon. One of them, Belo Monte, would displace at least 20,000 people and extinguish some of the world's most diverse habitats, in some areas flooding and in others drying up hundreds of square miles of rain forest and croplands, according to studies by \uc2 International Rivers\uc2  and others. It would produce more greenhouse gases than an equivalent fossil fuel plant, for at least 20 years. One executive in the construction consortium was sentenced to a 19-year prison term for corruption and money laundering, and the consortium is under investigation for allegedly paying millions in bribes to Brazil's beleaguered then-ruling party to secure the concession.\par \par \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  research published in 2014 indicates that most such dams worldwide will not recoup the cost of their construction, let alone improve standards of living for local populations. Such "white elephants" may not even be meant to serve their stated purposes. Rather, in the words of James Robinson and Ragnar Torvik, authors of an earlier study on large infrastructure projects in developing countries, "it is the very inefficiency of such projects that makes them . . . appealing" as vehicles for channeling money into the hands of a ruling coterie.\par \par \uc2 Honduras's Patuca III dam is just such a project. According to lawyer and veteran environmental activist Mauricio Torres, the river probably cannot build up sufficient pressure to generate the intended 104 megawatts: The water is too shallow and the topography too flat. A 2008 government-sponsored environmental impact assessment was "so weak," according to a 2012 letter from the \uc2 Inter-American Development Bank\uc2  to the Honduran government, "that we could not even envision starting to study [Tegucigalpa's request for project funding] seriously."\par \par \uc2 Mario Vallejo, a specialist in environmental law, is not surprised by such meaningless environmental oversight. He says it's the norm in Honduras. "There's an evaluation process that must happen before construction on such projects can begin," Vallejo explains. "But typically, work starts before the study is even completed. Developers get a license in a single day. It's called temporary, but it won't be revoked. And the impact assessments, when they're completed, accommodate what the constructors want."\par \par \uc2 When the IDB declined to finance Patuca III, the \uc2 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\uc2  stepped in with a loan. The Chinese engineering firm Sinohydro is racing to complete work by next spring, but the contract has raised eyebrows, even in kleptocratic Honduras. The somewhat independent Honduran National Anti-Corruption Council is investigating several officials at the national electricity agency for the alleged embezzlement of more than $4 million from the construction of the barracks that house Sinohydro's technicians and laborers.\par \par \uc2 Among the failings the IDB's assessment identified, the Honduran government neither adequately consulted with nor compensated affected communities. On a trip to the area last summer, two Honduran naturalists; my sister, artist and photographer Eve Chayes Lyman; and I amply confirmed that finding. Villagers told us they signed for government distributions of rice, for example, and those signatures were later used by the state electricity company as evidence that they approved of the dam.\par \par \uc2 According to media reports and numerous interviews, a 2015 protest against the project in Tegucigalpa was defused when the largest landowners - many of them wealthy absentee landlords - were paid off.\par \par \uc2 "The rich got a higher price for their land than we did," said a farmer we met on the road, riding a mare with a chestnut foal trotting behind. "They asked us and we said no. This earth doesn't have a price. But the rich said yes, and we're backed into a corner."\par \par \uc2 Late last year, when the second installment of promised compensation payments failed to materialize, landowners protested again, temporarily interrupting work on the project.\par \par \uc2 Every single person we interviewed along the river, above and below the dam site, detested the very idea of Patuca III. "It's a barbarism to nature," said a man who ran a small lunch counter by the worksite. "And the people living according to their ancestral traditions will be the worst affected."\par \par \uc2 To talk to them, the indigenous Tawahka and Miskito peoples who live downstream of the dam, we took to the river in one of the long wooden boats, "pipantes," that are the only mode of transport along the sinuous, silver artery. "This river is the road for all these communities," said Gil Cardones in Krautara, the first Tawahka village we visited. "Already the water's so low it's hard to navigate in winter."\par \par \uc2 According to the IDB's and other studies, changes in the river's flow also threaten several species of migrating fish, as well as lizards, crocodiles and turtles. "Now our people are having to abandon fishing," a young teacher told us at a community meeting in the largest Tawahka village, Krausirpi. "We are losing this whole part of our life and culture. The fish and turtles will go extinct."\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the Tawahkas hunted and foraged and fished and interspersed crops with untouched ground and overgrown fallow, preserving this last uninterrupted stretch of rain forest. Patuca III will accelerate its destruction.\par \par \uc2 For mile after mile upstream of this village, we had seen it: trees hacked off with machetes, the splintered stumps jutting skyward. The tropical wood isn't even salvaged. "They make boards to build their camps and burn the rest," said a man who'd asked for a ride in our boat. "It's too expensive to transport." Lime-green, deathly silent grass takes over where once stood a vibrant, multi-story forest filled with countless varieties of trees, vines, air plants, orchids, a riot of birdsong and hundreds of endangered species.\par \par \uc2 Another hitchhiker helped us understand how even apparently petty local corruption contributes to the devastation. As she grew comfortable with us, she began excoriating the mayor who presides over that stretch of river. Government-funded small-scale development projects, such as village clean-ups, used to provide a trickle of cash that residents need to buy amenities, pay for boat rides to larger towns a few times a year or to purchase medicine, she said, enabling them to retain their lands in an area bereft of public services or access to local markets where they could sell crops.\par \par \uc2 But under Mayor Walter Bertran Gonzales, the cash-for-work stopped.\par \par \uc2 "He gets 25,000 lempiras (about $1,100) in public funding to spend on this project, 25,000 for that project, but he carries it off on his shoulder," a farmer in the village of Bilalmo had told us the previous day. Newspaper reports echo the corruption allegations. As the projects dried up, depriving villagers of the meager wages they earned from making small repairs to public facilities, cleaning up their communities or other such efforts, residents turned to the only recourse they had: selling their land.\par \par \uc2 "In just the past year, almost all my neighbors have sold their land," the hitchhiker told my sister. "People have no other way to get money." The buyers "bring in outsiders to clear it and plant pasture for cows." Several people displaced from this area are known to have fled north to the United States.\par \par \uc2 According to some who dared talk about it, many of the buyers are narco-traffickers or their proxies. In the article "Drug Policy as Conservation Policy: Narco-Deforestation," Kendra McSweeney and her co-authors note the "close correlation between the timing and location of forest loss and drug transit." Buying and "improving" land by converting tropical forest into ranches is a good way to launder money. With two dozen villages about to be submerged or badly affected by this dam, and the pockets of wealthy absentee landlords suddenly flush with compensation, the hunger for land will only intensify.\par \par \uc2 But all of these transactions our passengers described are illegal. Under the 1999 decree that established territories downstream of the dam as a national park, its lands are either inalienable public patrimony or the collective property of indigenous peoples, and only inhabitants present when the decree was enacted may live there. The prosecutor's office has pleaded lack of resources to investigate complaints, says Erik Nielsen, one of the authors of the narco-deforestation article, so the "sales" proceed unchecked.\par \par \uc2 Such pretexts are to be expected in a country that is almost a textbook case of the systemic corruption I have been studying. Economic activity is dominated by less than a dozen families. Congress, operating out of a dilapidated 1950s building, has passed law after law lavishing incentives on their businesses, and helping President Juan Orlando Hern\u224\'00\'E0\u161\'00\'A1ndez consolidate power and shroud government activities in secrecy.\par \par \uc2 Environmental activists - in the world's deadliest country for them - have documented systematic bias on the part of the legal system, including persistent police harassment and false accusations leading to lengthy and expensive proceedings or unjust convictions. In the case of Berta Caceres, a locally beloved and internationally celebrated campaigner who was assassinated last year, the preposterous initial police suggestions that a botched robbery or a "crime of passion" had taken place, and the rush to investigate Caceres's fellow activists, fit the pattern.\par \par \uc2 After intense international pressure, the former vice minister of \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is in jail pending trial for illegally issuing the permit for the dam Caceres was protesting. If the allegations are accurate, it would be another example of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry's rubber-stamping that experts and practitioners describe.\par \par \uc2 Given Chinese President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 's high-profile anti-corruption campaign, Chinese businesses are beginning to think differently about \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  in cases like this. In fact, in 2013, Sinohydro pulled out of the project Caceres died protesting.\par \par \uc2 Patuca III is far worse, yet Sinohydro continues work on it.\par \par \uc2 And it's not as though its construction will improve ordinary Hondurans' lives, even if it does generate electricity. With the country losing nearly a third of its power through poorly maintained transmission systems, the explicit objective is to sell electricity to neighboring countries, according to Giovanni Ayestas, head of social relations at UEPER, the government agency managing Patuca III. And thus generate a cash flow ripe for capture.\par \par \uc2 Stepping ashore as we nosed our boat onto the bank below her village, our hitchhiker summed up what we had been hearing for days: "That dam will kill us."\par \par \uc2 It won't leave the rest of us untouched, either. Irreplaceable environmental treasures such as the Patuca River and its surrounding national park belong to us all, not just a handful of kleptocrats. Only persistent public pressure can reliably protect the wild lands that are everyone's birthright - whether they lie in national monuments west of the Rockies or in Appalachia or along the Patuca

On the map, the region is a fat green stripe, indicating two national parks end to end. But the water, as I trail my fingers in the warm bath, is tawny brown. It is carrying way too much sediment: acres of dirt washed down by the deforestation that's making way for cattle ranches along the supposedly protected banks, and tons more dumped by construction on a massive hydroelectric dam a day's voyage upstream.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Both are existential threats to this place and its people. And both are products of the pervasive and sophisticated corruption that characterizes the Honduran government.\par \par \uc2 I have spent a decade living through and researching how corruption has helped fuel some of the world's most significant security crises \u8212\'20\'14 from the expansion of violent extremism to revolutions and their bloody aftermaths. Last year, I began wondering if similar links exist between corruption and another grave threat: environmental devastation. It didn't take long to find them.\par \par \uc2 Corruption, in this context, should not be understood as merely the opportunistic lapses of an underpaid game warden or a customs agent who looks the other way in exchange for an envelope. Rather, in Honduras and more than 60 other countries worldwide, senior officials, key business leaders and out-and-out criminals weave themselves into sophisticated networks for the purpose of maximizing personal gains. Natural resources are a principal source of the cash these kleptocrats capture.\par \par \uc2 One of the most lucrative is oil. Nigeria's national oil company, to pick an egregious example, could not account for nearly $20\u160\'00\'A0billion in revenue from 2012 and 2013 alone. A byproduct of such looting \u8212\'20\'14 and the predatory attitudes it engenders \u8212\'20\'14 is the oil-soaked Niger Delta. The once-vibrant web of winding creeks and inlets is black with sludge, its mangroves gone, grasses and palm trees reduced to tar-smeared stumps. People who once navigated their slender-bowed boats and swam, fished and gathered shellfish there now find an oily sheen in their well water. They suffer skin and lung ailments.\par \par \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  admits to more than 1,800 spills there in the past decade. In January 2015, \uc2 Shell\uc2  agreed to pay $84 million to settle a lawsuit about just two of these. Meanwhile, according to \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2 , Nigeria's National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency continues to certify visibly filthy areas as clean.\par \par \uc2 This pattern is consistent across the corrupt countries I have studied: Agencies charged with protecting the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  are rendered functionally inoperative \u8212\'20\'14 budgets are slashed, staff is short or demotivated, equipment goes missing. Predatory extraction of natural resources for personal gain requires lax enforcement of whatever regulations exist. In Nigeria's case, the predators aren't just the huge oil multinationals, whose behavior may be encouraged by the ambiguous nature of many of their dealings with officials they know are corrupt, but also host-country operators and outright thieves, who often work in partnership with government institutions. When they see the magnitude of the theft at the top of the pyramid, they consider themselves entitled.\par \par \uc2 In countries that lack hydrocarbons, other natural resources substitute. The investigative charity \uc2 Global Witness\uc2  has documented the Cambodian ruling clique's control of an illegal logging syndicate that is stripping that country of its tropical forest.\par \par \uc2 The United States obviously does not fall into the same category as Nigeria or Cambodia when it comes to corruption. Still, certain trends should alarm Americans. Consider West Virginia, where, in 2004, the chief executive of Massey Energy smeared a judge and bankrolled the campaign of a previously unknown judicial rival, who, once elected, ruled favorably on cases affecting the coal company \u8212\'20\'14 including at least one the company had lost in a jury trial. Judge Brent Benjamin argued that there was no basis for presuming that the $3\u160\'00\'A0million Massey spent on his campaign might affect his impartiality.\par \par \uc2 This is the same Massey executive who was sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to violate mine safety rules in a 2010 explosion that killed 29 miners. Over the years, Massey has taken advantage of the lax enforcement guaranteed by the coal industry's hold over West Virginia politics, not just to repeatedly ignore health and safety requirements, but also to decapitate forested mountains and routinely dump rubble, slurry and wastewater into the state's rivers.\par \par \uc2 Another conduit for corruption: dams. Brazil's sprawling corruption scandal has implicated several mega-dams in the Amazon. One of them, Belo Monte, would displace at least 20,000 people and extinguish some of the world's most diverse habitats, in some areas flooding and in others drying up hundreds of square miles of rain forest and croplands, according to studies by \uc2 International Rivers\uc2  and others. It would produce more greenhouse gases than an equivalent fossil fuel plant, for at least 20 years. One executive in the construction consortium was sentenced to a 19-year prison term for corruption and money laundering, and the consortium is under investigation for allegedly paying millions in bribes to Brazil's beleaguered then-ruling party to secure the concession.\par \par \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  research published in 2014 indicates that most such dams worldwide will not recoup the cost of their construction, let alone improve standards of living for local populations. Such "white elephants" may not even be meant to serve their stated purposes. Rather, in the words of James Robinson and Ragnar Torvik, authors of an earlier study on large infrastructure projects in developing countries, "it is the very inefficiency of such projects that makes them .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. appealing" as vehicles for channeling money into the hands of a ruling coterie.\par \par \uc2 Honduras's Patuca III dam is just such a project. According to lawyer and veteran environmental activist Mauricio Torres, the river probably cannot build up sufficient pressure to generate the intended 104 megawatts: The water is too shallow and the topography too flat. A 2008 government-sponsored environmental impact assessment was "so weak," according to a 2012 letter from the \uc2 Inter-American Development Bank\uc2  to the Honduran government, "that we could not even envision starting to study [Tegucigalpa's request for project funding] seriously."\par \par \uc2 Mario Vallejo, a specialist in environmental law, is not surprised by such meaningless environmental oversight. He says it's the norm in Honduras. "There's an evaluation process that must happen before construction on such projects can begin," Vallejo explains. "But typically, work starts before the study is even completed. Developers get a license in a single day. It's called temporary, but it won't be revoked. And the impact assessments, when they're completed, accommodate what the constructors want."\par \par \uc2 When the IDB declined to finance Patuca III, the \uc2 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\uc2  stepped in with a loan. The Chinese engineering firm Sinohydro is racing to complete work by next spring, but the contract has raised eyebrows, even in kleptocratic Honduras. The somewhat independent Honduran National Anti-Corruption Council is investigating several officials at the national electricity agency for the alleged embezzlement of more than $4 million from the construction of the barracks that house Sinohydro's technicians and laborers.\par \par \uc2 Among the failings the IDB's assessment identified, the Honduran government neither adequately consulted with nor compensated affected communities. On a trip to the area last summer, two Honduran naturalists; my sister, artist and photographer Eve Lyman; and I amply confirmed that finding. Villagers told us they signed for government distributions of rice, for example, and those signatures were later used by the state electricity company as evidence that they approved of the dam.\par \par \uc2 According to media reports and numerous interviews, a 2015 protest against the project in Tegucigalpa was defused when the largest landowners \u8212\'20\'14 many of them wealthy absentee landlords \u8212\'20\'14 were paid off.\par \par \uc2 "The rich got a higher price for their land than we did," said a farmer we met on the road, riding a mare with a chestnut foal trotting behind. "They asked us and we said no. This earth doesn't have a price. But the rich said yes, and we're backed into a corner."\par \par \uc2 Late last year, when the second installment of promised compensation payments failed to materialize, landowners protested again, temporarily interrupting work on the project.\par \par \uc2 Every single person we interviewed along the river, above and below the dam site, detested the very idea of Patuca III. "It's a barbarism to nature," said a man who ran a small lunch counter by the worksite. "And the people living according to their ancestral traditions will be the worst affected."\par \par \uc2 To talk to them, the indigenous Tawahka and Miskito peoples who live downstream of the dam, we took to the river in one of the long wooden boats, "pipantes," that are the only mode of transport along the sinuous, silver artery. "This river is the road for all these communities," said Gil Cardones in Krautara, the first Tawahka village we visited. "Already the water's so low it's hard to navigate in winter."\par \par \uc2 According to the IDB's and other studies, changes in the river's flow also threaten several species of migrating fish, as well as lizards, crocodiles and turtles. "Now our people are having to abandon fishing," a young teacher told us at a community meeting in the largest Tawahka village, Krausirpi. "We are losing this whole part of our life and culture. The fish and turtles will go extinct."\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the Tawahkas hunted and foraged and fished and interspersed crops with untouched ground and overgrown fallow, preserving this last uninterrupted stretch of rain forest. Patuca III will accelerate its destruction.\par \par \uc2 For mile after mile upstream of this village, we had seen it: trees hacked off with machetes, the splintered stumps jutting skyward. The tropical wood isn't even salvaged. "They make boards to build their camps and burn the rest," said a man who'd asked for a ride in our boat. "It's too expensive to transport." Lime-green, deathly silent grass takes over where once stood a vibrant, multi-story forest filled with countless varieties of trees, vines, air plants, orchids, a riot of birdsong and hundreds of endangered species.\par \par \uc2 Another hitchhiker helped us understand how even apparently petty local corruption contributes to the devastation. As she grew comfortable with us, she began excoriating the mayor who presides over that stretch of river. Government-funded small-scale development projects, such as village clean-ups, used to provide a trickle of cash that residents need to buy amenities, pay for boat rides to larger towns a few times a year or to purchase medicine, she said, enabling them to retain their lands in an area bereft of public services or access to local markets where they could sell crops.\par \par \uc2 But under Mayor Walter Bertran Gonzales, the cash-for-work stopped.\par \par \uc2 "He gets 25,000 lempiras (about $1,100) in public funding to spend on this project, 25,000 for that project, but he carries it off on his shoulder," a farmer in the village of Bilalmo had told us the previous day. Newspaper reports echo the corruption allegations. As the projects dried up, depriving villagers of the meager wages they earned from making small repairs to public facilities, cleaning up their communities or other such efforts, residents turned to the only recourse they had: selling their land.\par \par \uc2 "In just the past year, almost all my neighbors have sold their land," the hitchhiker told my sister. "People have no other way to get money." The buyers "bring in outsiders to clear it and plant pasture for cows." Several people displaced from this area are known to have fled north to the United States.\par \par \uc2 According to some who dared talk about it, many of the buyers are narco-traffickers or their proxies. In the article "Drug Policy as Conservation Policy: Narco-Deforestation ," Kendra McSweeney and her co-authors note the "close correlation between the timing and location of forest loss and drug transit ." Buying and "improving" land by converting tropical forest into ranches is a good way to launder money. With two dozen villages about to be submerged or badly affected by this dam, and the pockets of wealthy absentee landlords suddenly flush with compensation, the hunger for land will only intensify.\par \par \uc2 But all of these transactions our passengers described are illegal. Under the 1999 decree that established territories downstream of the dam as a national park, its lands are either inalienable public patrimony or the collective property of indigenous peoples, and only inhabitants present when the decree was enacted may live there. The prosecutor's office has pleaded lack of resources to investigate complaints, says Erik Nielsen, one of the authors of the narco-deforestation article, so the "sales" proceed unchecked.\par \par \uc2 Such pretexts are to be expected in a country that is almost a textbook case of the systemic corruption I have been studying. Economic activity is dominated by less than a dozen families. Congress, operating out of a dilapidated 1950s building, has passed law after law lavishing incentives on their businesses, and helping President Juan Orlando Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez consolidate power and shroud government activities in secrecy.\par \par \uc2 Environmental activists \u8212\'20\'14 in the world's deadliest country for them \u8212\'20\'14 have documented systematic bias on the part of the legal system, including persistent police harassment and false accusations leading to lengthy and expensive proceedings or unjust convictions. In the case of Berta Caceres, a locally beloved and internationally celebrated campaigner who was assassinated last year, the preposterous initial police suggestions that a botched robbery or a "crime of passion" had taken place, and the rush to investigate Caceres's fellow activists, fit the pattern.\par \par \uc2 After intense international pressure, the former vice minister of \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is in jail pending trial for illegally issuing the permit for the dam Caceres was protesting. If the allegations are accurate, it would be another example of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry's rubber-stamping that experts and practitioners describe.\par \par \uc2 Given Chinese President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 's high-profile anti-corruption campaign, Chinese businesses are beginning to think differently about \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  in cases like this. In fact, in 2013, Sinohydro pulled out of the project Caceres died protesting.\par \par \uc2 Patuca III is far worse, yet Sinohyrdo continues work on it.\par \par \uc2 And it's not as though its construction will improve ordinary Hondurans' lives, even if it does generate electricity. With the country losing nearly a third of its power through poorly maintained transmission systems, the explicit objective is to sell electricity to neighboring countries, according to Giovanni Ayestas, head of social relations at UEPER, the government agency managing Patuca III. And thus generate a cash flow ripe for capture.\par \par \uc2 Stepping ashore as we nosed our boat onto the bank below her village, our hitchhiker summed up what we had been hearing for days: "That dam will kill us."\par \par \uc2 It won't leave the rest of us untouched, either. Irreplaceable environmental treasures such as the Patuca River and its surrounding national park belong to us all, not just a handful of kleptocrats.

Both business academics and the winning chief executives themselves warn that if sustainability remains a marketing message rather than being deeply rooted in an organisation\u8217\'20\'19s culture, companies risk losing the trust of staff, the public and investors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CPeople can smell inauthenticity,\u8221\'20\'1D says David Grayson, director of the Doughty Centre for Corporate Responsibility at Cranfield School of Management. \u8220\'20\'1CIf business is claiming one thing and is operating in another way, that is a dangerous position to be in.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 For \uc2 Business in the Community\uc2  (BITC), the UK charity that runs the awards announced at the Royal Albert Hall in London on Tuesday night, winners must show tangible social and environmental impact. Two companies receive the Responsible Business of the Year Award: the regional utility \uc2 Anglian Water Services\uc2  and \u8212\'20\'14 in the small and medium enterprises category \u8212\'20\'14 We Are Vista, a creative communications agency.\par \par \uc2 The judges were impressed by Anglian\u8217\'20\'19s wide-ranging Love Every Drop strategy, which promises to \u8220\'20\'1Cfundamentally change\u8221\'20\'1D how the company works. Goals include cutting pollution, waste and water leakages. Starting in 2010, Anglian cut its operational carbon footprint by 10 per cent by 2015 and carbon emissions from capital construction projects by half. It aims for net carbon neutrality by mid-century. The company built solar arrays and wind turbines and favours suppliers that support its goals.\par \par \uc2 We Are Vista takes a similarly broad approach. The agency promotes diversity, personal development and employee volunteering while also reducing its environmental impact. A five-year sustainability plan includes a 20 per cent cut in office energy consumption and a 30 per cent decrease in waste to landfill by 2019.\par \par \uc2 While both companies have set ambitious sustainability targets, their leaders stress that meeting these requires businesses to go beyond statements from executives or handing over the work to a \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  (CSR) department. Anglian made a conscious decision not to create such a unit, says Peter Simpson, chief executive. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t have a separate strategy associated with being a responsible business \u8212\'20\'14 that is the strategy. There is only one.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 James Wilkins, managing director of We Are Vista, also warns of the dangers of treating sustainability as an add-on. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you\u8217\'20\'19re not careful, it becomes a series of measures that you manage and audit rather than something you\u8217\'20\'19re mobilising people [to tackle],\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 Companies must clearly articulate sustainability goals and create targets that are ambitious but tangible and related to their business, he adds.\par \par \uc2 Businesses\u8217\'20\'19 definitions of sustainability vary and this is reflected in the diversity of award winners. \uc2 National Grid\uc2 , a winner of the BITC Award for Environmental Leadership, focused on greenhouse gases from energy generation. The company included a requirement for carbon reduction in its tendering process.\par \par \uc2 Tesco\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 winner of the Experian Award for Building Stronger Communities \u8212\'20\'14 focused on food poverty. The company launched Community Food Connection, which uses an app to connect stores that have surplus food with local charities.\par \par \uc2 Creating a culture of sustainability can be difficult when employees are also juggling demands ranging from pressure to cut costs to meeting sales targets.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt\u8217\'20\'19s making the linkage to the strategy and thinking about how that relates to the nature of the business,\u8221\'20\'1D says Prof Grayson. \u8220\'20\'1CThen it is the hard slog of aligning that with compensation, executive development, training and communications messages.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For some, sustainability may mean saying no to business. \u8220\'20\'1CWe recently turned down working with a Middle Eastern bank and with a large tobacco company,\u8221\'20\'1D says Mr Wilkins of We Are Vista. He adds that external factors create hurdles to pursuing a sustainable strategy. \u8220\'20\'1CThe current level of disruption and the pace of change could give lots of people an excuse for not doing it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 For some companies, however, a responsible business strategy helps to navigate disruption. This has been the case for Unipart, a winner of the Fujitsu Award for Responsible Business in the Digital Age. Rather than using digital technology to replace workers, the UK manufacturer is training employees to create new digital products and services, increasing their value to the company and enhancing their employability.\par \par \uc2 For Mr Wilkins, establishing a culture of sustainability helps build a collaborative spirit, equipping companies to respond quickly to shifts in the business landscape. \u8220\'20\'1CYou end up with a group of people connected to a bigger idea,\u8221\'20\'1D he says. \u8220\'20\'1CSo you get more cross-working and a willingness to change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The 2017 Responsible Business Awards winners\par \par \uc2 Business in the Community\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s Responsible Business of the Year\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Anglian Water Services\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF We Are Vista*\par \par \uc2 The Aviva Award for Championing an Ageing Workforce\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Barclays\par \par \uc2 The Barclays Award for Building Resilient Business\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Adler & Allan\par \par \uc2 The BITC Award for Environmental Leadership, supported by the \uc2 Department for \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Food & Rural Affairs\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 National Grid\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF The Lakes Free Range Egg Company*\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Highly commended: British Sugar\par \par \uc2 The Experian Award for Building Stronger Communities\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Tesco\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Highly commended: Engie, Energy and Services\par \par \uc2 The Fujitsu Award for Responsible Business in the Digital Age\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Unipart\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Parcelly*\par \par \uc2 The UBS Award for Education\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Esh Group\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Dragon LNG\uc2 *\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Highly commended: \uc2 British Land\par \par \uc2 The Unilever Global Development Award, supported by Business Fights Poverty\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF SunnyMoney\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF WaterHealth International\par \par \uc2 The Unipart Award for Outstanding Employment\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 National Grid\par \par \uc2 The UPS International Disaster Relief & Resilience Award, supported by the \uc2 Department for International Development\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF \uc2 Cisco\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF What3words*\par \par \uc2 \u9679\'25\'CF Highly commended: Dr Zigs;

And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.\par \par \uc2 These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation\u8217\'20\'19s political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from climate change to health care.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, \uc2 Mary T. Barra\uc2 , called on people to \u8220\'20\'1Ccome together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us \u8212\'20\'14 tolerance, inclusion and diversity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  of \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  said, \u8220\'20\'1CThe equal treatment of all people is one of our nation\u8217\'20\'19s bedrock principles.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Walmart\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive, \uc2 Doug McMillon\uc2 , criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.\par \par \uc2 And in a rebuke to the president, who suggested that both the racist groups and the counterprotesters marching in Charlottesville were to blame for the violence there, a wave of chief executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/trumps-council-ceos.html?mcubz=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 quit his business advisory councils}}}\uc2 , leading to the dissolution of two groups.\par \par \uc2 The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years \u8212\'20\'14 the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement \u8212\'20\'14 is \u8220\'20\'1Ca seminal moment in the history of business in America,\u8221\'20\'1D said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThese C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This transformation didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.\par \par \uc2 Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.\par \par \uc2 But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u8212\'20\'14 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.\par \par \uc2 In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNot every business decision is an economic one,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 , the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country\u8217\'20\'19s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u8220\'20\'1CThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Looking for Controversy\par \par \uc2 Companies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u8217\'20\'19s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u8217\'20\'19s desegregated.\par \par \uc2 Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including \uc2 General Motors\uc2  and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.\par \par \uc2 But for the most part, companies got political only under duress. Rarely have chief executives gone looking for a controversy. Instead, the prevailing view was one articulated by the economist Milton Friedman {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E0DA153CE531A15750C1A96F9C946190D6CF&mcubz=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in The New York Times}}}\uc2  in 1970: \u8220\'20\'1Cthe social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. \uc2 Apple\uc2 , \uc2 Disney\uc2  and \uc2 Xerox\uc2  extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen I went to business school, you didn\u8217\'20\'19t see anything like this,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Marc Benioff\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u8220\'20\'1CNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u8212\'20\'14 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u8212\'20\'14 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, after Indiana passed a law that would have made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay people, Mr. Benioff {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/indiana-law-denounced-as-invitation-to-discriminate-against-gays.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 canceled all Salesforce events in the state}}}\uc2  and threatened to relocate employees away from Indianapolis.\par \par \uc2 The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Benioff said. \u8220\'20\'1CNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The business community\u8217\'20\'19s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.\par \par \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2 , the chief executive of AT&T, recently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/dealbook/for-att-chief-time-warner-deal-is-the-peak-of-an-ambitious-climb.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reflected on racial tensions in America}}}\uc2  at a meeting of 2,000 employees. \u8220\'20\'1CBlack lives matter,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Stephenson said, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe should not say, \u8216\'20\'18All lives matter,\u8217\'20\'19 to justify ignoring the real need for change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder and chief executive of the yogurt maker Chobani, has hired hundreds of refugees \u8212\'20\'14 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/for-helping-immigrants-chobanis-founder-draws-threats.html?_r=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 drawing the ire}}}\uc2  of the far right, but making him a cause c\u233\'00\'E9l\u232\'00\'E8bre for progressives.\par \par \uc2 And even before the showdown in Indiana, \uc2 Timothy D. Cook\uc2 , the chief executive of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest company, \uc2 Apple\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/technology/timothy-cook-apples-chief-executive-says-he-is-proud-to-be-gay.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 came out as gay}}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the most prominent executive to make such an announcement. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote.\par \par \uc2 None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2  was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. \uc2 Martin Winterkorn\uc2 , a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u8217\'20\'19s emissions scandal.\par \par \uc2 But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , the chief executive of Tesla, and \uc2 Robert A. Iger\uc2 , the chief of \uc2 Disney\uc2 , resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u8217\'20\'19s revolt.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u8217\'20\'19t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u8221\'20\'1D said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u8220\'20\'1CBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Many Sides,\u8217\'20\'19 One Voice\par \par \uc2 Last weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u8217\'20\'19s response. Among those watching was \uc2 Kenneth C. Frazier\uc2 , the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u8217\'20\'19s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u8217\'20\'19s remarks \u8212\'20\'14 in which he blamed the violence on \u8220\'20\'1Cmany sides\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 were too much to bear.\par \par \uc2 On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s manufacturing council. \u8220\'20\'1CAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote.\par \par \uc2 The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2  and \uc2 Intel\uc2  had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.\par \par \uc2 As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u8217\'20\'19s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.\par \par \uc2 The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\par \par \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2 , the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/us/politics/james-murdoch-trump-donation-anti-defamation-league.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pledged to donate}}}\uc2  $1 million to the \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 . The gesture was all the more remarkable because Mr. Murdoch is the son of \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, and because his company operates Fox News, known for its favorable coverage of the president.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u8221\'20\'1D the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Technology companies {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://qz.com/1055141/what-websites-and-apps-have-banned-neo-nazis-and-white-supremacists/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 severed ties}}}\uc2  with white supremacist groups. \uc2 Google\uc2  and GoDaddy dropped domain registrations for far right publications. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  deleted articles that celebrated hate crimes. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/business/media/white-power-rock-bands-find-platform-online-to-incite-hatred.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Spotify took down music}}}\uc2  by white power rock bands.\par \par \uc2 And in Seattle, Mr. Schultz {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://news.starbucks.com/news/hate-has-no-home-here"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 held a town-hall meeting}}}\uc2  for more than 1,000 employees where he condemned bigotry and called for unity. \u8220\'20\'1CI could sense the anxiety,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CI felt a need to create a safe and loving \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 All week, the business world\u8217\'20\'19s actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor a long time, \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,\u8221\'20\'1D said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. \u8220\'20\'1CNow it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The Cost of Speaking Out\par \par \uc2 Kevin Plank\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president\u8217\'20\'19s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u8220\'20\'1CI strongly disagree with \uc2 Kevin Plank\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s recent comments in support of Trump,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.\par \par \uc2 So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Walker of the \uc2 Ford Foundation\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Because companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\par \par \uc2 When Pepsi this year released an ad featuring Kendall Jenner offering a police officer a soda in the midst of an apparent Black Lives Matter protest, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 condemnation was swift}}}\uc2 . Two years earlier, \uc2 Starbucks{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/business/media/starbucks-ends-tempestuous-initiative-on-race.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 drew wide ridicule}}}\uc2  when, as part of an effort by Mr. Schultz to start a national conversation on race relations, baristas were encouraged to write \u8220\'20\'1Crace together\u8221\'20\'1D on coffee cups.\par \par \uc2 Companies on the conservative end of the ideological spectrum are also increasingly willing to stand up for their principles, and just as likely to face criticism. After it was revealed that the family behind the fast-food chain \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  supported groups that opposed same-sex marriage, gay rights protesters {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/us/gay-rights-uproar-over-chick-fil-a-widens.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 targeted the restaurants}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hobby Lobby, the craft-supply chain run by a conservative Christian family, challenged a provision in the Affordable Care Act that required family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for birth control. Despite drawing the ire of the left, Hobby Lobby {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/us/hobby-lobby-case-supreme-court-contraception.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 took its case to the Supreme Court}}}\uc2  and won.\par \par \uc2 Critics of Mr. Plank\u8217\'20\'19s decision cast their net wide, going after all the chief executives who quit the president\u8217\'20\'19s business advisory groups. \u8220\'20\'1CThis is a remarkable moment in history,\u8221\'20\'1D {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RR8zFJJdU"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 said Lou Dobbs}}}\uc2 , a \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2  host. \u8220\'20\'1CEvery one of those C.E.O.s, mark my words, is a coward \u8212\'20\'14 and the president is exactly right \u8212\'20\'14 a grandstander in the service of the left. And no one should make any mistake: This is a coordinated, orchestrated attack against this president.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 John Carney\uc2 , a business editor for Breitbart News, the conservative news site, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/08/17/corporate-antifa-ceos-revolt-against-american-democracy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 wrote that}}}\uc2  \u8220\'20\'1Ccorporate America is part of the opposition.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Carney wrote. \u8220\'20\'1CThe battle lines are clear.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Those executives who go out on a limb know the risks. \u8220\'20\'1CWe all recognize that with every decision we make, there is group of people that are not going to agree with us,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Schultz said. \u8220\'20\'1CBut you must define your core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A Diversity Paradox\par \par \uc2 Diversity \u8212\'20\'14 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u8212\'20\'14 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u8212\'20\'14 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u8212\'20\'14 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.\par \par \uc2 Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness leaders aren\u8217\'20\'19t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Walker said. \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u8212\'20\'14 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u8220\'20\'1COur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Benioff of \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.\par \par \uc2 The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u8212\'20\'14 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u8212\'20\'14 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur country\u8217\'20\'19s strength stems from its diversity,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote, adding, \u8220\'20\'1CAmerica\u8217\'20\'19s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The C.E.O.s had found their voice.\par \par \uc2 Follow David Gelles on Twitter @dgelles.\par \par \uc2 PHOTOS: Executives who have publicly taken stands on political issues: top row from left, \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2  of \uc2 Starbucks\uc2 , \uc2 Mary T.

And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.\par \par \uc2 These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation\u8217\'20\'19s political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/globalwarming/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 climate change}}}\uc2  to health care.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, \uc2 Mary T. Barra\uc2 , called on people to \u8220\'20\'1Ccome together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us \u8212\'20\'14 tolerance, inclusion and diversity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  of \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  said, \u8220\'20\'1CThe equal treatment of all people is one of our nation\u8217\'20\'19s bedrock principles.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Walmart\u8217\'20\'19s chief executive, Doug McMillon, criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.\par \par \uc2 And in a rebuke to the president, who suggested that both the racist groups and the counterprotesters marching in Charlottesville were to blame for the violence there, a wave of chief executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/trumps-council-ceos.html?mcubz=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 quit his business advisory councils}}}\uc2 , leading to the dissolution of two groups.\par \par \uc2 The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years \u8212\'20\'14 the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement \u8212\'20\'14 is \u8220\'20\'1Ca seminal moment in the history of business in America,\u8221\'20\'1D said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThese C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This transformation didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.\par \par \uc2 Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.\par \par \uc2 But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within \u8212\'20\'14 from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.\par \par \uc2 In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CNot every business decision is an economic one,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 , the chairman of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/starbucks-corporation?inline=nyt-org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Starbucks}}}\uc2 , who was one of the country\u8217\'20\'19s first company leaders to proactively address social issues. \u8220\'20\'1CThe reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Looking for Controversy\par \par \uc2 Companies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth\u8217\'20\'19s store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth\u8217\'20\'19s desegregated.\par \par \uc2 Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including \uc2 General Motors\uc2  and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.\par \par \uc2 But for the most part, companies got political only under duress. Rarely have chief executives gone looking for a controversy. Instead, the prevailing view was one articulated by the economist Milton Friedman {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E05E0DA153CE531A15750C1A96F9C946190D6CF&mcubz=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 in The New York Times}}}\uc2  in 1970: \u8220\'20\'1Cthe social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. \uc2 Apple\uc2 , \uc2 Disney\uc2  and \uc2 Xerox\uc2  extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhen I went to business school, you didn\u8217\'20\'19t see anything like this,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Marc Benioff\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. \u8220\'20\'1CNobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected \u8212\'20\'14 to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders \u8212\'20\'14 than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, after Indiana passed a law that would have made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay people, Mr. Benioff {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/us/politics/indiana-law-denounced-as-invitation-to-discriminate-against-gays.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 canceled all Salesforce events in the state}}}\uc2  and threatened to relocate employees away from Indianapolis.\par \par \uc2 The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CC.E.O.s wield economic influence,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Benioff said. \u8220\'20\'1CNobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The business community\u8217\'20\'19s triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.\par \par \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2 , the chief executive of AT&T, recently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/dealbook/for-att-chief-time-warner-deal-is-the-peak-of-an-ambitious-climb.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reflected on racial tensions in America}}}\uc2  at a meeting of 2,000 employees. \u8220\'20\'1CBlack lives matter,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Stephenson said, \u8220\'20\'1Cwe should not say, \u8216\'20\'18All lives matter,\u8217\'20\'19 to justify ignoring the real need for change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Hamdi Ulukaya, the founder and chief executive of the yogurt maker Chobani, has hired hundreds of refugees \u8212\'20\'14 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/for-helping-immigrants-chobanis-founder-draws-threats.html?_r=0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 drawing the ire}}}\uc2  of the far right, but making him a cause c\u233\'00\'E9l\u232\'00\'E8bre for progressives.\par \par \uc2 And even before the showdown in Indiana, \uc2 Timothy D. Cook\uc2 , the chief executive of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest company, \uc2 Apple\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/technology/timothy-cook-apples-chief-executive-says-he-is-proud-to-be-gay.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 came out as gay}}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 the most prominent executive to make such an announcement. \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote.\par \par \uc2 None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2  was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. \uc2 Martin Winterkorn\uc2 , a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company\u8217\'20\'19s emissions scandal.\par \par \uc2 But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , the chief executive of Tesla, and \uc2 Robert A. Iger\uc2 , the chief of \uc2 Disney\uc2 , resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week\u8217\'20\'19s revolt.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe C.E.O.s of big public companies don\u8217\'20\'19t walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,\u8221\'20\'1D said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. \u8220\'20\'1CBut today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 \u8216\'20\'18Many Sides,\u8217\'20\'19 One Voice\par \par \uc2 Last weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president\u8217\'20\'19s response. Among those watching was \uc2 Kenneth C. Frazier\uc2 , the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president\u8217\'20\'19s stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president\u8217\'20\'19s remarks \u8212\'20\'14 in which he blamed the violence on \u8220\'20\'1Cmany sides\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 were too much to bear.\par \par \uc2 On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s manufacturing council. \u8220\'20\'1CAs C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote.\par \par \uc2 The president took to Twitter, lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/topic/company/under-armour-inc?inline=nyt-org"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Under Armour}}}\uc2  and \uc2 Intel\uc2  had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.\par \par \uc2 As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country\u8217\'20\'19s biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.\par \par \uc2 The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\par \par \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2 , the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/us/politics/james-murdoch-trump-donation-anti-defamation-league.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pledged to donate}}}\uc2  $1 million to the \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 . The gesture was all the more remarkable because Mr. Murdoch is the son of \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, and because his company operates Fox News, known for its favorable coverage of the president.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,\u8221\'20\'1D the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. \u8220\'20\'1CI can\u8217\'20\'19t even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis.

Yet when asked to serve on the president\u8217\'20\'19s manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 His star sponsors made their displeasure known. \u8220\'20\'1CI strongly disagree with \uc2 Kevin Plank\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s recent comments in support of Trump,\u8221\'20\'1D Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.\par \par \uc2 So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Walker of the \uc2 Ford Foundation\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBut speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Because companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\par \par \uc2 When Pepsi this year released an ad featuring Kendall Jenner offering a police officer a soda in the midst of an apparent Black Lives Matter protest, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 condemnation was swift}}}\uc2 .

After it was revealed that the family behind the fast-food chain \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  supported groups that opposed same-sex marriage, gay rights protesters {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/us/gay-rights-uproar-over-chick-fil-a-widens.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 targeted the restaurants}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Hobby Lobby, the craft-supply chain run by a conservative Christian family, challenged a provision in the Affordable Care Act that required family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for birth control.

We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 A Diversity Paradox\par \par \uc2 Diversity \u8212\'20\'14 of opinions, ideologies and religions \u8212\'20\'14 is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity \u8212\'20\'14 of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force \u8212\'20\'14 that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.\par \par \uc2 Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness leaders aren\u8217\'20\'19t threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Walker said. \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness leaders are bullish on diversity.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What\u8217\'20\'19s more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations \u8212\'20\'14 it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. \u8220\'20\'1COur employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,\u8221\'20\'1D said Mr. Benioff of \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBusiness is the greatest platform for affecting change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 If the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump\u8217\'20\'19s business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.\par \par \uc2 The black chief executive of a $172 billion company \u8212\'20\'14 a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president \u8212\'20\'14 Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur country\u8217\'20\'19s strength stems from its diversity,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote, adding, \u8220\'20\'1CAmerica\u8217\'20\'19s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The C.E.O.s had found their voice.\par \par \uc2 Follow David Gelles on Twitter @dgelles.\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/16/business/trumps-council-ceos.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Inside the C.E.O.

The culture wars are back, waged over transgender rights and immigration. White nationalists are on the march.\par \par \uc2 Amid this turbulence, a surprising group of Americans is testing its moral voice more forcefully than ever: C.E.O.s.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 After Nazi-saluting white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville, Va., and President Trump dithered in his response, a chorus of business leaders rose up this past week to condemn hate groups and espouse tolerance and inclusion. And as lawmakers in Texas tried to restrict the rights of transgender people to use public bathrooms, corporate executives joined activists to kill the bill.\par \par \uc2 These and other actions are part of a broad recasting of the voice of business in the nation's political and social dialogue, a transformation that has gained momentum in recent years as the country has engaged in fraught debates over everything from climate change to health care.\par \par \uc2 In recent days, after the Charlottesville bloodshed, the chief executive of General Motors, \uc2 Mary T. Barra\uc2 , called on people to ''come together as a country and reinforce values and ideals that unite us -- tolerance, inclusion and diversity.''\par \par \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2  of \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  said, ''The equal treatment of all people is one of our nation's bedrock principles.''\par \par \uc2 Walmart's chief executive, Doug McMillon, criticized Mr. Trump by name for his handling of the violence in Charlottesville, and called for healing.\par \par \uc2 And in a rebuke to the president, who suggested that both the racist groups and the counterprotesters marching in Charlottesville were to blame for the violence there, a wave of chief executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump quit his business advisory councils, leading to the dissolution of two groups.\par \par \uc2 The forthright engagement of these and other executives with one of the most charged political issues in years -- the swelling confidence of a torch-bearing, swastika-saluting, whites-first movement -- is ''a seminal moment in the history of business in America,'' said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at \uc2 PepsiCo\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''In this maelstrom, the most clarifying voice has been the voice of business,'' he said. ''These C.E.O.s have taken the risk to speak truth to power.''\par \par \uc2 This transformation didn't happen overnight. Chief executives face a constellation of pressures, and speaking up can create considerable uncertainty. Customers can be offended, colleagues can feel isolated and relations with lawmakers can suffer. Words and actions can backfire, resulting in public relations disasters. All this as a chief executive is expected to constantly grow sales.\par \par \uc2 Even this past week, it was easy to discern careful calculations made by executives who chose to speak out against Mr. Trump. Many faced calls to resign from the presidential advisory councils, and the prospect of boycotts if they did not.\par \par \uc2 But they also faced notable and new kinds of pressure from within -- from employees who expect or encourage their company to stake out positions on numerous controversial social or economic causes, and from board members concerned with reputational issues. In the past week, business leaders have responded with all-staff memos and town-hall meetings.\par \par \uc2 In short, while companies are naturally designed to be moneymaking enterprises, they are adapting to meet new social and political expectations in sometimes startling ways.\par \par \uc2 ''Not every business decision is an economic one,'' said \uc2 Howard Schultz\uc2 , the chairman of Starbucks, who was one of the country's first company leaders to proactively address social issues. ''The reason people are speaking up is that we are fighting for what we love and believe in, and that is the idealism and the aspiration of America, the promise of America, the America that we all know and hold so true.''\par \par \uc2 Looking for Controversy\par \par \uc2 Companies have reckoned with issues of race, class and gender for generations now.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 1, 1960, four black college students sat down at the segregated lunch counter at a Woolworth's store in Greensboro, N.C. The civil rights sit-in movement was born, and five months later, Woolworth's desegregated.\par \par \uc2 Decades later, activists called on American companies to divest from apartheid South Africa. Under pressure, many big companies, including \uc2 General Motors\uc2  and Pepsi, pulled out of the country.\par \par \uc2 But for the most part, companies got political only under duress. Rarely have chief executives gone looking for a controversy. Instead, the prevailing view was one articulated by the economist Milton Friedman in The \uc2 New York Times\uc2  in 1970: ''the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.''\par \par \uc2 By the 1990s, some corporate actors began taking the initiative. \uc2 Apple\uc2 , \uc2 Disney\uc2  and \uc2 Xerox\uc2  extended health care benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees, helping to pave the way for broader acceptance of gay rights. Still, promoting inclusion and advancing diversity were hardly part of the curriculum for emerging titans of industry.\par \par \uc2 ''When I went to business school, you didn't see anything like this,'' said \uc2 Marc Benioff\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of Salesforce. ''Nobody talked about taking a stand or adopting a cause.''\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. Benioff is at the vanguard of a group of executives who are more connected -- to customers, employees, investors and other business leaders -- than ever before, and who are unafraid to use their influence.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, after Indiana passed a law that would have made it easier for religious conservatives to refuse service to gay people, Mr. Benioff canceled all \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  events in the state and threatened to relocate employees away from Indianapolis.\par \par \uc2 The outcry from Mr. Benioff and other business leaders helped force politicians, including Vice President \uc2 Mike Pence\uc2 , then the governor of Indiana, to reverse course. Ultimately, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of the law.\par \par \uc2 ''C.E.O.s wield economic influence,'' Mr. Benioff said. ''Nobody wanted to lose those jobs in Indiana. But we had to make a statement that we were going to withdraw if they were going to create laws that were going to discriminate against our employees.''\par \par \uc2 The business community's triumph in Indiana emboldened progressive executives, and many have become more willing to confront controversial topics unprompted.\par \par \uc2 Randall Stephenson\uc2 , the chief executive of AT&T, recently reflected on racial tensions in America at a meeting of 2,000 employees. ''Black lives matter,'' Mr. Stephenson said, ''we should not say, 'All lives matter,' to justify ignoring the real need for change.''\par \par \uc2 Hamdi Ulukaya\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of the yogurt maker Chobani, has hired hundreds of refugees -- drawing the ire of the far right, but making him a cause c\u233\'00\'E9l\u232\'00\'E8bre for progressives.\par \par \uc2 And even before the showdown in Indiana, \uc2 Timothy D. Cook\uc2 , the chief executive of the world's largest company, \uc2 Apple\uc2 , came out as gay -- the most prominent executive to make such an announcement. ''I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 None of this is to say that all corporate leaders are now beacons of morality. The Uber co-founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2  was ousted amid a mushrooming sexual abuse scandal at the company, and reports that he had cultivated a frat house culture. \uc2 Martin Winterkorn\uc2 , a chief executive of Volkswagen, resigned amid his company's emissions scandal.\par \par \uc2 But faced with circumstances they cannot in good conscience accept, more and more chieftains appear unafraid to act. In June, after the president withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord, \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , the chief executive of Tesla, and \uc2 Robert A. Iger\uc2 , the chief of \uc2 Disney\uc2 , resigned from presidential advisory councils, setting the stage for this past week's revolt.\par \par \uc2 ''The C.E.O.s of big public companies don't walk out onto the plank of social and political leadership by default,'' said Nancy Koehn, a historian at Harvard Business School. ''But today, to keep silent is to jeopardize the reputation of the company.''\par \par \uc2 'Many Sides,' One Voice\par \par \uc2 Last weekend, as white nationalists protested the removal of a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, chief executives were paying close attention to the president's response. Among those watching was \uc2 Kenneth C. Frazier\uc2 , the chief executive of the drugmaker Merck and one of dozens of executives who had agreed to advise Mr. Trump on economic issues.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Frazier disagreed with the president's stances on immigration and climate change, but he believed it was important to have a seat at the table. Yet for Mr. Frazier, the son of a janitor and the grandson of a man born into slavery, the president's remarks -- in which he blamed the violence on ''many sides'' -- were too much to bear.\par \par \uc2 On Monday morning, Mr. Frazier said he would step down from Mr. Trump's manufacturing council. ''As C.E.O. of Merck and as a matter of personal conscience, I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 The president took to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , lacerating Mr. Frazier and attacking Merck, bluster that alienated more chief executives. By the end of the day, the chiefs of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2  and \uc2 Intel\uc2  had dropped off the same advisory group. The following morning, three nonprofit business leaders also quit.\par \par \uc2 As the manufacturing council fell apart, another presidential advisory group was also tottering. The Strategic and Policy Forum, a group with chief executives of some of the country's biggest companies, held a conference call and agreed to disband.\par \par \uc2 The reaction from business leaders extended well beyond the confines of the presidential advisory councils.\par \par \uc2 James Murdoch\uc2 , the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, pledged to donate $1 million to the \uc2 Anti-Defamation League\uc2 . The gesture was all the more remarkable because Mr. Murdoch is the son of \uc2 Rupert Murdoch\uc2 , a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump, and because his company operates Fox News, known for its favorable coverage of the president.\par \par \uc2 ''What we watched this last week in Charlottesville and the reaction to it by the President of the United States concern all of us as Americans and free people,'' the younger Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email to associates. ''I can't even believe I have to write this: standing up to Nazis is essential; there are no good Nazis. Or Klansmen, or terrorists.''\par \par \uc2 Technology companies severed ties with white supremacist groups. \uc2 Google\uc2  and GoDaddy dropped domain registrations for far right publications. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  deleted articles that celebrated hate crimes. Spotify took down music by white power rock bands.\par \par \uc2 And in Seattle, Mr. Schultz held a town-hall meeting for more than 1,000 employees where he condemned bigotry and called for unity. ''I could sense the anxiety,'' he said. ''I felt a need to create a safe and loving \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 All week, the business world's actions went beyond the donations to charity and pledges to plant trees that once defined \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''For a long time, \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  was a buzzword marketing tool, walled off within an organization,'' said Alan Fleischmann, president of Laurel Strategies, an executive advisory firm. ''Now it has to be central for the C.E.O., part of their everyday responsibility and leadership.''\par \par \uc2 The Cost of Speaking Out\par \par \uc2 Kevin Plank\uc2 , the founder and chief executive of Under Armour, the athletic apparel maker, built a brand that celebrates diversity, sponsoring athletes like the basketball player Stephen Curry and artists like the ballerina Misty Copeland. Yet when asked to serve on the president's manufacturing council early this year, Mr. Plank agreed, voicing his optimism about Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 His star sponsors made their displeasure known. ''I strongly disagree with \uc2 Kevin Plank\uc2 's recent comments in support of Trump,'' Ms. Copeland said. Mr. Curry also expressed his distaste for the president.\par \par \uc2 So on Monday night, when Mr. Plank stepped down from his advisory role, he might have thought his troubles were over. Instead, Mr. Trump's supporters have risen up, calling for a boycott of \uc2 Under Armour\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''The leaders of corporate America have demonstrated the courage to call out something that is unacceptable,'' said Mr. Walker of the \uc2 Ford Foundation\uc2 . ''But speaking truth to power can come with huge costs.''\par \par \uc2 Because companies have inherently diverse customers and employees, taking a stand can be a no-win situation for chief executives. For every employee, investor and customer they make happy, they may well make someone else unhappy.\par \par \uc2 When Pepsi this year released an ad featuring Kendall Jenner offering a police officer a soda in the midst of an apparent Black Lives Matter protest, the condemnation was swift. Two years earlier, \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  drew wide ridicule when, as part of an effort by Mr. Schultz to start a national conversation on race relations, baristas were encouraged to write ''race together'' on coffee cups.\par \par \uc2 Companies on the conservative end of the ideological spectrum are also increasingly willing to stand up for their principles, and just as likely to face criticism. After it was revealed that the family behind the fast-food chain \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  supported groups that opposed same-sex marriage, gay rights protesters targeted the restaurants.\par \par \uc2 Hobby Lobby, the craft-supply chain run by a conservative Christian family, challenged a provision in the Affordable Care Act that required family-owned corporations to pay for insurance coverage for birth control. Despite drawing the ire of the left, Hobby Lobby took its case to the Supreme Court and won.\par \par \uc2 Critics of Mr. Plank's decision cast their net wide, going after all the chief executives who quit the president's business advisory groups. ''This is a remarkable moment in history,'' said Lou Dobbs, a \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2  host. ''Every one of those C.E.O.s, mark my words, is a coward -- and the president is exactly right -- a grandstander in the service of the left. And no one should make any mistake: This is a coordinated, orchestrated attack against this president.''\par \par \uc2 John Carney\uc2 , a business editor for Breitbart News, the conservative news site, wrote that ''corporate America is part of the opposition.''\par \par \uc2 ''The confederacy of the media institutions, the American left, and Corporate America has aligned itself against the populist uprising that brought Trump to the White House,'' Mr. Carney wrote. ''The battle lines are clear.''\par \par \uc2 Those executives who go out on a limb know the risks. ''We all recognize that with every decision we make, there is group of people that are not going to agree with us,'' Mr. Schultz said. ''But you must define you core purpose for being. We stand in the interest of something greater than just making money.''\par \par \uc2 A Diversity Paradox\par \par \uc2 Diversity -- of opinions, ideologies and religions -- is what makes taking a stand on moral issues so treacherous for C.E.O.s. Yet paradoxically, it is also diversity -- of races, genders and worldviews, among customers and the work force -- that makes many of the executives, when forced to take a stand, come down on the side of inclusion, tolerance and acceptance.\par \par \uc2 Business leaders looking to the future are accepting that it is unwise to isolate swaths of the population by coming off as racist, sexist or intolerant. Instead, for the sake of the bottom line, it is imperative that they appeal to the widest possible audience. ''Business leaders aren't threatened by an America that is browner, an America that is more diverse; they welcome that,'' Mr. Walker said. ''Business leaders are bullish on diversity.''\par \par \uc2 What's more, some executives have concluded that speaking out on issues of morality can improve more than their reputations -- it can benefit recruitment, morale and even sales. ''Our employees come here knowing that this is something that is extremely important to us,'' said Mr. Benioff of \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 . ''Business is the greatest platform for affecting change.''\par \par \uc2 If the voices of business leaders seem amplified, that is perhaps because in such partisan times, few politicians can speak to both sides of the aisle, leaving a vacuum for business leaders to fill. This last week, the executives on Mr. Trump's business advisory councils piped up, led by Mr. Frazier of Merck.\par \par \uc2 The black chief executive of a $172 billion company -- a multimillionaire who was born in a poor neighborhood, a former lawyer who fought for civil rights and had agreed to advise the president -- Mr. Frazier offered remarks that set the tone for the business world at large.\par \par \uc2 ''Our country's strength stems from its diversity,'' he wrote, adding, ''America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal.''\par \par \uc2 The C.E.O.s had found their voice.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RF\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Follow David Gelles on Twitter @dgelles.\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b ART\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Executives who have publicly taken stands on political issues: top row from left, Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Mary T.

On the map, the region is a fat green stripe, indicating two national parks end to end. But the water, as I trail my fingers in the warm bath, is tawny brown. It is carrying way too much sediment: acres of earth washed down by the deforestation that's making way for cattle ranches along the supposedly protected banks, and tons more dumped by construction on a massive hydroelectric dam a day's voyage upstream.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Both are existential threats to this place and its people. And both are products of the pervasive and sophisticated corruption that characterizes the Honduran government.\par \par \uc2 I have spent a decade living through and researching how corruption has helped fuel some of the world's most significant security crises \u8212\'20\'14 from the expansion of violent extremism to revolutions and their bloody aftermaths. Last year, I began wondering whether similar links exist between corruption and another grave threat: environmental devastation. It didn't take long to find them.\par \par \uc2 Corruption, in this context, should not be understood as merely the opportunistic lapses of an underpaid game warden or a customs agent who looks the other way in exchange for an envelope. Rather, in Honduras and more than 60 other countries worldwide, senior officials, key business leaders and out-and-out criminals weave themselves into sophisticated networks for the purpose of maximizing personal gains. Natural resources are a principal source of the cash these kleptocrats capture.\par \par \uc2 One of the most lucrative rackets is oil. Nigeria's national oil company, to pick an egregious example, could not account for nearly $20\u160\'00\'A0billion in revenue from 2012 and 2013 alone. A byproduct of such looting \u8212\'20\'14 and the predatory attitudes it engenders \u8212\'20\'14 is the oil-soaked Niger Delta. The once-vibrant web of winding creeks and inlets is black with sludge, its mangroves gone, grasses and palm trees reduced to tar-smeared stumps. People who once navigated their slender-bowed boats and swam, fished and gathered shellfish there now find an oily sheen in their well water. They suffer skin and lung ailments.\par \par \uc2 Royal Dutch Shell\uc2  admits to more than 1,800 spills there in the past decade. In January 2015, \uc2 Shell\uc2  agreed to pay $84 million to settle a lawsuit about just two of these. Meanwhile, according to \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2 , Nigeria's National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency continues to certify visibly filthy areas as clean.\par \par \uc2 This pattern is consistent across the corrupt countries I have studied: Agencies charged with protecting the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  are rendered functionally inoperative \u8212\'20\'14 budgets are slashed, staff is short or demotivated, equipment goes missing. Predatory extraction of natural resources for personal gain requires lax enforcement of whatever regulations exist. In Nigeria's case, the predators aren't just the huge oil multinationals, whose behavior may be encouraged by the ambiguous nature of many of their dealings with officials they know are corrupt, but also host-country operators and outright thieves, who often work in partnership with government institutions. When they see the magnitude of the theft at the top of the pyramid, they consider themselves entitled.\par \par \uc2 In countries that lack hydrocarbons, other natural resources substitute. The investigative charity \uc2 Global Witness\uc2  has documented the Cambodian ruling clique's control of an illegal logging syndicate that is stripping the country of its tropical forest.\par \par \uc2 The United States obviously does not fall into the same category as Nigeria or Cambodia when it comes to corruption. Still, certain trends should alarm Americans. Consider West Virginia, where, in 2004, the chief executive of Massey Energy smeared a judge and bankrolled the campaign of a previously unknown judicial rival, who, once elected, ruled favorably on cases affecting the coal company \u8212\'20\'14 including at least one the company had lost in a jury trial. Judge Brent Benjamin argued that there was no basis for presuming that the $3\u160\'00\'A0million Massey spent on his campaign might affect his impartiality.\par \par \uc2 This is the same Massey executive who was sentenced to a year in prison for conspiring to violate mine safety rules in a 2010 explosion that killed 29 miners. Over the years, Massey has taken advantage of the lax enforcement guaranteed by the coal industry's hold over West Virginia politics, not just to repeatedly ignore health and safety requirements, but also to decapitate forested mountains and routinely dump rubble, slurry and wastewater into the state's rivers.\par \par \uc2 Another conduit for corruption: dams. Brazil's sprawling corruption scandal has implicated several mega-dams in the Amazon. One of them, Belo Monte, would displace at least 20,000 people and extinguish some of the world's most diverse habitats, in some areas flooding and in others drying up hundreds of square miles of rain forest and croplands, according to studies by \uc2 International Rivers\uc2  and others. It would produce more greenhouse gases than an equivalent fossil fuel plant, for at least 20 years. One executive in the construction consortium was sentenced to a 19-year prison term for corruption and money laundering, and the consortium is under investigation for allegedly paying millions in bribes to Brazil's beleaguered then-ruling party to secure the concession.\par \par \uc2 Oxford University\uc2  research published in 2014 indicates that most such dams worldwide will not recoup the cost of their construction, let alone improve standards of living for local populations. Such "white elephants" may not even be meant to serve their stated purposes. Rather, in the words of James Robinson and Ragnar Torvik, authors of an earlier study on large infrastructure projects in developing countries, "it is the very inefficiency of such projects that makes them .\u8201\'20\'09.\u8201\'20\'09. appealing" as vehicles for channeling money into the hands of a ruling coterie.\par \par \uc2 Honduras's Patuca III dam is just such a project. According to lawyer and veteran environmental activist Mauricio Torres, the river probably cannot build up sufficient pressure to generate the intended 104 megawatts: The water is too shallow and the topography too flat. A 2008 government-sponsored environmental impact assessment was "so weak," according to a 2012 letter from the \uc2 Inter-American Development Bank\uc2  to the Honduran government, "that we could not even envision starting to study [Tegucigalpa's request for project funding] seriously."\par \par \uc2 Mario Vallejo, a specialist in environmental law, is not surprised by such meaningless environmental oversight. He says it's the norm in Honduras. "There's an evaluation process that must happen before construction on such projects can begin," Vallejo explains. "But typically, work starts before the study is even completed. Developers get a license in a single day. It's called temporary, but it won't be revoked. And the impact assessments, when they're completed, accommodate what the constructors want."\par \par \uc2 When the IDB declined to finance Patuca III, the \uc2 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\uc2  stepped in with a loan. The Chinese engineering firm Sinohydro is racing to complete work by next spring, but the contract has raised eyebrows, even in kleptocratic Honduras. The somewhat independent Honduran National Anti-Corruption Council is investigating several officials at the national electricity agency for the alleged embezzlement of more than $4\u160\'00\'A0million from the construction of the barracks that house Sinohydro's technicians and laborers.\par \par \uc2 Among the failings the IDB's assessment identified, the Honduran government neither adequately consulted with nor compensated affected communities. On a trip to the area last summer, two Honduran naturalists; my sister, artist and photographer Eve Chayes Lyman; and I amply confirmed that finding. Villagers told us that they signed for government distributions of rice, for example, and that those signatures were later used by the state electricity company as evidence that they approved of the dam.\par \par \uc2 According to media reports and numerous interviews, a 2015 protest against the project in Tegucigalpa was defused when the largest landowners \u8212\'20\'14 many of them wealthy absentee landlords \u8212\'20\'14 were paid off.\par \par \uc2 "The rich got a higher price for their land than we did," said a farmer we met on the road, riding a mare with a chestnut foal trotting behind. "They asked us and we said no. This earth doesn't have a price. But the rich said yes, and we're backed into a corner."\par \par \uc2 Late last year, when the second installment of promised compensation payments failed to materialize, landowners protested again, temporarily interrupting work on the project.\par \par \uc2 Every single person we interviewed along the river, above and below the dam site, detested the very idea of Patuca III. "It's a barbarism to nature," said a man who ran a small lunch counter by the work site. "And the people living according to their ancestral traditions will be the worst affected."\par \par \uc2 To talk to them, the indigenous Tawahka and Miskito peoples who live downstream of the dam, we took to the river in one of the long wooden boats, "pipantes," that are the only mode of transport along the sinuous, silver artery. "This river is the road for all these communities," said Gil Cardones in Krautara, the first Tawahka village we visited. "Already, the water's so low it's hard to navigate in winter."\par \par \uc2 According to the IDB's and other studies, changes in the river's flow also threaten several species of migrating fish, as well as lizards, crocodiles and turtles. "Now our people are having to abandon fishing," a young teacher told us at a community meeting in the largest Tawahka village, Krausirpi. "We are losing this whole part of our life and culture. The fish and turtles will go extinct."\par \par \uc2 Until recently, the Tawahkas hunted and foraged and fished and interspersed crops with untouched ground and overgrown fallow, preserving this last uninterrupted stretch of rain forest. Patuca III will accelerate its destruction.\par \par \uc2 For mile after mile upstream of this village, we had seen it: trees hacked off with machetes, the splintered stumps jutting skyward. The tropical wood isn't even salvaged. "They make boards to build their camps and burn the rest," said a man who'd asked for a ride in our boat. "It's too expensive to transport." Lime-green, deathly silent grass takes over where once stood a vibrant, multistory forest filled with countless varieties of trees, vines, air plants, orchids, a riot of birdsong and hundreds of endangered species.\par \par \uc2 Another hitchhiker helped us understand how even apparently petty local corruption contributes to the devastation. As she grew comfortable with us, she began excoriating the mayor who presides over that stretch of river. Government-funded small-scale development projects, such as village cleanups, used to provide a trickle of cash that residents need to buy amenities, pay for boat rides to larger towns a few times a year or to purchase medicine, she said, enabling them to retain their lands in an area bereft of public services or access to local markets where they could sell crops.\par \par \uc2 But under Mayor Walter Bertran Gonzales, the cash-for-work program stopped.\par \par \uc2 "He gets 25,000 lempiras (about $1,100) in public funding to spend on this project, 25,000 for that project, but he carries it off on his shoulder," a farmer in the village of Bilalmo had told us the previous day. Newspaper reports echo the corruption allegations. As the projects dried up, depriving villagers of the meager wages they earned from making small repairs to public facilities, cleaning up their communities or other such efforts, residents turned to their only recourse: selling their land.\par \par \uc2 "In just the past year, almost all my neighbors have sold their land," the hitchhiker told my sister. "People have no other way to get money." The buyers "bring in outsiders to clear it and plant pasture for cows." Several people displaced from this area are known to have fled north to the United States.\par \par \uc2 According to some who dared talk about it, many of the buyers are narco-traffickers or their proxies. In the article "Drug Policy as Conservation Policy: Narco-Deforestation," Kendra McSweeney and her co-authors note the "close correlation between the timing and location of forest loss and drug transit." Buying and "improving" land by converting tropical forest into ranches is a good way to launder money. With two dozen villages about to be submerged or badly affected by this dam, and the pockets of wealthy absentee landlords suddenly flush with compensation, the hunger for land will only intensify.\par \par \uc2 But all of these transactions our passengers described are illegal. Under the 1999 decree that established territories downstream of the dam as a national park, its lands are either inalienable public patrimony or the collective property of indigenous peoples, and only inhabitants present when the decree was enacted may live there. The prosecutor's office has pleaded a lack of resources to investigate complaints, says Erik Nielsen, one of the authors of the narco-deforestation article, so the "sales" proceed unchecked.\par \par \uc2 Such pretexts are to be expected in a country that is almost a textbook case of the systemic corruption I have been studying. Economic activity is dominated by fewer than a dozen families. Congress, operating out of a dilapidated 1950s building, has passed law after law lavishing incentives on their businesses, and helping President Juan Orlando Hern\u225\'00\'E1ndez consolidate power and shroud government activities in secrecy.\par \par \uc2 Environmental activists \u8212\'20\'14 in the world's deadliest country for their work \u8212\'20\'14 have documented systematic bias on the part of the legal system, including persistent police harassment and false accusations leading to lengthy and expensive proceedings or unjust convictions. In the case of Berta Caceres, a locally beloved and internationally celebrated campaigner who was assassinated last year, the preposterous initial police suggestions that a botched robbery or a "crime of passion" had taken place, and the rush to investigate Caceres's fellow activists, fit the pattern.\par \par \uc2 After intense international pressure, the former vice minister of \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is in jail pending trial for illegally issuing the permit for the dam that Caceres was protesting. If the allegations are accurate, it would be another example of the \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Ministry's rubber-stamping that experts and practitioners describe.\par \par \uc2 Given Chinese President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 's high-profile anti-corruption campaign, Chinese businesses are beginning to think differently about \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  in cases like this. In fact, in 2013, Sinohydro pulled out of the project Caceres died protesting.\par \par \uc2 Patuca III is far worse, yet Sinohydro continues work on it.\par \par \uc2 And it's not as though its construction will improve ordinary Hondurans' lives, even if it does generate electricity. With the country losing nearly a third of its power through poorly maintained transmission systems, the explicit objective is to sell electricity to neighboring countries, according to Giovanni Ayestas, head of social relations at UEPER, the government agency managing Patuca III. And thus generate a cash flow ripe for capture.\par \par \uc2 Stepping ashore as we nosed our boat onto the bank below her village, our hitchhiker summed up what we had been hearing for days: "That dam will kill us."\par \par \uc2 It won't leave the rest of us untouched, either. Irreplaceable environmental treasures such as the Patuca River and its surrounding national park belong to us all, not just to a handful of kleptocrats.

Parity in the workforce alone is not what matters most for value creation,\u8221\'20\'1D says \uc2 Vivian Hunt\uc2 , McKinsey\u8217\'20\'19s UK managing partner.\par \par \uc2 McKinsey used publicly available data from 2012-2015 to analyse gender diversity at the executive level at 754 companies across sectors and in all regions of the globe. The ethnic diversity of the top team was analysed at 495 companies across all regions.\par \par \uc2 It found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity at executive level were 22 per cent more likely to outperform their national industry average than bottom-quartile companies in terms of profitability, as measured by earnings before interest and tax (ebit). For banks and insurers, return on equity was used as a proxy for financial performance.\par \par \uc2 When the research focused on a broader measure of performance, the distinction was even more marked.\par \par \uc2 Using \u8220\'20\'1Ceconomic profit\u8221\'20\'1D, which measures a company\u8217\'20\'19s ability to create value in excess of its weighted cost of capital, the differential between the top and the bottom quartile of companies was even greater, at 67 per cent.\par \par \uc2 The research also confirmed that there is a penalty for lack of diversity. Companies in the bottom quartile on both gender and ethnic diversity at the executive level underperformed companies in higher quartiles, whether this was measured in terms of operating profit performance or economic profit.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere is a widening gap between those who are leading in this area and those who are not,\u8221\'20\'1D says Ms Hunt.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe leaders understand the rewards but also, increasingly \u8212\'20\'14 if you are not aware of how [diversity] links to your business strategy, or you are tone-deaf about your message on this \u8212\'20\'14 the penalties are much greater.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Having a diverse workforce as well as a diverse top team affected profitability too. The research found that greater gender diversity was linked to higher operating profitability at the whole-company level as well as in the executive team.\par \par \uc2 Measured by ebit performance, companies in the top quartile in terms of the gender diversity of their whole workforce were 46 per cent more likely than those in the bottom quartile to outperform their industry average.\par \par \uc2 McKinsey found that companies in the top-performing quartile for diversity shared several important policies or characteristics:\par \par \uc2 * The chief executive was committed publicly and internally to improving diversity.\par \par \uc2 * There were more women in executive positions.\par \par \uc2 * Diversity goals were part of the business strategy and value chain.\par \par \uc2 * The definition of diversity used was both tailored to the business strategy and to the local contexts in which the company operated.\par \par \uc2 Ms Hunt adds: \u8220\'20\'1CIn the top performers, diversity is genuinely integrated into a company\u8217\'20\'19s growth strategy. [It is] not an add-on for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

My name is Kris Coratti. I'm vice president of communications and events here at The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 . Thank you for joining us this morning. Today, we're going to discuss corporate and government sustainability efforts. We'll look at how some of America's biggest companies are making sustainability a part of their business model and we're going to hear about the work being done to promote equitable \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  standards. So before we begin, I'd like to thank our sponsors: The University of Virginia Darden School of Business and Samsung for supporting today's program and now, I'd like to get started and introduce to you The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2 's \uc2 Juliet Eilperin\uc2 . She's going to lead today's first discussion.

I'm \uc2 Juliet Eilperin\uc2 , the senior national affairs correspondent for The Washington Post. I'm here with \uc2 Lisa Jackson\uc2 , who is the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and currently serves as vice president for \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , Policy, and Social Initiatives at Apple. She is also the only cabinet member I've ever interviewed who has sung Stevie Wonder in the course of an interview. Another claim to fame. [LAUGHS] And before I get started, I'd like to remind everyone in our audience and those who are watching online that you can tweet questions for Lisa using the #WorldinBalance and I will take a few of those throughout our conversation with the help of an iPad.\par \par \uc2 So with that, \uc2 Apple\uc2  has pledged to shift to 100% renewable energy and I understand you're now at 96% for your global facilities. I was wondering if you could talk about what's been some of the hardest aspects of meeting that goal and perhaps what's been easiest about that.\par \par \uc2 Jackson: I think the real innovation came for challenges like datacenters. So \uc2 Apple\uc2  was the first to run a datacenter 100% on renewable energy and it's kind of easy. In California, where we have energy choice. So you can say, "I want to purchase clean energy to run by datacenter in California." But it's harder in states like North Carolina or Nevada where you actually have to work with the utility and the community to actually build and develop clean energy. In those cases, it's solar power. So that was a challenge because when you think about datacenters, they can never go down so you have to think about a solution that works, that's resilient.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Well, what have you found? What's your backstop? Are there particular\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Jackson: In the old days, the backstop was fuel cells. It's still there in North Carolina as well as the fact that we're connected to the grid, partially because you have to be. You can't generate your own so you connect to the grid and then pull back. So the grid is a great backstop for us as well. We have to work with the utilities. As we're building newer datacenters, what we're finding is that especially in parts of Europe, the transmission grid is in better shape. It's more resilient, more redundant and so you can actually have clean energy as your primary and as your backstop.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And have there been increased costs and how have you dealt with that or has it ultimately been cost-neutral to\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Jackson: No, we challenge ourselves to be cost-neutral or even sometimes, cheaper than what we'd estimate brown power to be. In some cases, we use PPAs and part of the calculation around the PPA is\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Can you explain it to our audience?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: A PPA is a power purchase agreement. It's like a long-term contract, so obviously, you're looking at the long-term costs of conventional power and you're trying to decide whether construction development of new clean power, with the incentives that come along with it, but sometimes without; it depends. It can actually be better for the company.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: So your more recent pledge has been to construct a closed-loop supply chain where products are made only using renewable resources and recycled material. You have your little robot Liam, right? Who is doing some of that work. Can you talk a little about how that's a slightly different task and how you're going about doing that?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Energy\u8212\'20\'14we'll come back to energy because I think it's so incredibly important but one of the things I loved about \uc2 Apple\uc2  and deciding to go was that we're a product company. We make hardware and obviously, it's what people use. We touch consumers there so there's a moment where we can really get consumers to appreciate what we stand for, but we also use a lot of material to do that. And materials are mined from the Earth. There's been studies, but I think it's almost 100 different elements from the periodic table are actually in your iPhone and so people are starting to be concerned about that from the standpoint of what mining does to the planet. Also, the social implications. And so we run a really strong program to deal with those issues. And I think we're the only ones in our sector thinking this was. What if we can start to think about a time when an iPhone is made from totally recycled materials or totally renewable materials, like a biomaterial?\par \par \uc2 So we're starting our brilliant engineers to work on that. It's really fun. It's fun to sit around the table with folks who spend all day thinking about aluminum alloys, for example. And we've made huge progress. The iPhone 10 and 8\u8212\'20\'14no, sorry, 8, because 10 has stainless steel in it but the aluminum that's in the iPhone 8 and 8+ is actually much lower carbon than aluminum before and we did that through a combination of how the aluminum is melted. We'd like to find hydropower as a source there. But also just being a lot more efficient with aluminum and then I just should give a plug to our program that does work on supply chains. Just today, the Enough Project listed us as number one for our work on cobalt sourcing around the world.\par \par \uc2 Cobalt is used in batteries in our products. And \uc2 Amnesty International\uc2  yesterday said we were number one in our sector for the work we're doing there as well.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And so you do a lot of travel in your job, including to China, of course, India, right? And Europe and I'm wondering if you could talk a little about what it is like given the new administration and the shift in positions on many of the policies that you and then your successor, Gina McCarthy put in place. What are the kinds of discussions that you're having with leaders of other countries and what is it like also when in many ways, they might be touting what they're doing, but we just had statistics that came out on Monday showing that carbon emissions globally are rising and that much of that is driven by China, although, obviously, the United States consistently comes in as number two. So could you talk about what these conversations are like and how you navigate your role, both as an American and as someone representing a major company like \uc2 Apple\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: I think after the initial shock at the change in the position, we don't spend\u8212\'20\'14I don't personally spend a lot of time talking about the policy because I'm not a policymaker. That's not my job anymore. I certainly can't explain policies for this administration. [LAUGHTER] But I do think that we spend a lot of time trying to deal with the challenges so people will often want to understand not only I work to be 100% renewable, but also, I work in our supply chain. So we've moved onto 14 of our suppliers around the world to pledge to be 100% renewable for their work with \uc2 Apple\uc2  and we'd like to get our whole supply chain there. China has real challenges, but I think the difference I see in the conversations even maybe from my days as \uc2 EPA\uc2  until now; so that time frame is\u8212\'20\'14a lot of people cynically looked at China and thought, "Okay, they're just saying whatever because they want the world to not be upset if they scuttle the Paris deal, for example."\par \par \uc2 Now, when you're in China, you see it as an imperative for them. Obviously, they have air pollution issue that are significant. But they also have a lot more people and a lot of densely populated cities and they know that their populations are moving into cities. So they're really interested in clean energy; electric-powered vehicles, for example. Because they need to find a solution for traffic, which is a significant part of the air pollution they have. So whether it's China\u8212\'20\'14India the same way. I think what you find are people who are motivated by something other than politics because they have real-world pollution issues and they see the burning of fossil fuels is causing a lot of environmental problems, climate change being one. So when you start to address that and move to less intense carbon processes, you start to address more than one problem.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And while it's true you're not in your policy position, we'll talk some policy and one thing is that last year, \uc2 Apple\uc2  did join \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , and other Silicon Valley companies and \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  as well to sign an amicus brief in support of the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 's Clean Power Plan, which right now, the \uc2 EPA\uc2  is in the process of withdrawing. Can you talk about what is the role of these companies when it comes to national policy, particularly in this area of climate energy and the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ? What's your proper role in it and why is it that these firms decided that they wanted to file a brief in this case?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Business needs certainty. It's funny because when I was at the \uc2 EPA\uc2 , that's what I heard constantly from businesses. They were like, "Listen, we want to comply. We want to be on the right side of your agency. We never want to see you, but we need to understand where this is going." And so I think you find companies like hours who are saying, "We've made these investments because we believe it's the right thing to do because we also believe they're not bad for business; they're good for business because we also know that our customers around the world\u8212\'20\'14we're a multinational business and we sell around the world\u8212\'20\'14expect it from us and so what we'd like you to understand is that we'd like to continue on a trajectory that has a predictable reduction in carbon over time. We've sort of invested in a belief that the future needs to be low carbon and eventually, zero carbon. And we believe as Silicon Valley that innovation is really important in terms of getting there. And so for us at \uc2 Apple\uc2  it was\u8212\'20\'14and our CEO has been really clear about this\u8212\'20\'14we need to speak up for the things we believe in and one of the things we're pretty strong on around the world is the need to fight climate change and to use materials responsibly.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And when you make that kind of business argument, right, which essentially you're making a business and economic argument to, for example, whether it's Republican officials here in Washington, whether it's potentially on the Hill or in the administration or if you're having those discussions with governors or in the states where \uc2 Apple\uc2 's presence\u8212\'20\'14are people receiving and hearing that and incorporating it? To what extent is that resonating with some of the maybe officeholders that might be less inclined to immediately sign on to dramatic climate initiatives and things like that?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: A lot of our work is at the state level in this country because there isn't a major climate change bill moving forward right now in Congress. So there's nothing to work on right now. But at the state level, states have seen the economic growth potential of investing in clean energy. So recently, I was in Iowa because we announced a new datacenter there. We're definitely not the first technology company to go there but Iowa's made a huge bet on wind energy because they happen to be very rich in it and it's very compatible with another huge land use they have, which is agriculture. You don't have to pick one or the other. What you might have to do if say you had a lot of mining or fossil fuel exploration and development and so what you find is that governors and mayors and it's devoid of politics in terms of red or blue are looking at, "What are the opportunities for my people to get jobs in this sector?" And we had the same thing in North Carolina. We, of course, run into skeptics but our position is, "Look, we don't want it to cost more for your customers or ratepayers in your state." We're not asking to be subsidized by them, but we do believe that this is an opportunity for us to show you that a business like ours, one we think is very future-oriented can run on clean energy.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And now I want to shift and talk a little bit about science and about how that, for example, plays a role in policymaking here. Obviously, you're trained as a chemical engineer and worked for \uc2 EPA\uc2  as a career employee before heading the agency and a lot of what, of course, my colleagues and I spend our time writing about is how science is being done at the agency right now and other agencies. We certainly are both seeing a questioning of the agency's own science by \uc2 Scott Pruitt\uc2  and others who argue that it's led to predetermined outcomes. We've seen an overhaul of these outside advisory boards. There are 22 of them total where they're saying that any scientist who has received an \uc2 EPA\uc2  grant should either choose between getting funding from the agency or helping guide its science. Could you talk a little about how you see science being done at \uc2 EPA\uc2 , both in the past and now and what is the interplay between how research and findings are made at \uc2 EPA\uc2  and how that leads to a policy outcome, since there's been a lot of it.\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Pretty much everything the \uc2 EPA\uc2  does is subject to a lawsuit and it doesn't matter who does it. It's not me, it's not the current administration, and so the really important underpinnings of defending those lawsuits are science. The other thing I would say\u8212\'20\'14I am a chemical engineer by training. I have a master's in it, chem E. I often say to folks, people ask me all the time, "I really care about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . What should I major in?" And I say, "If you can, engineering. If not, environmental science. But make sure if you have an interest in science that you try to put that forward." Because people assume I think because the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is trees and nature that nature must be simple. But it's actually very complex. Air modeling, we used to make jokes about the folks at \uc2 EPA\uc2  who do air modeling. But they're incredibly smart mathematicians.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Were you arguing they were geekier than other \uc2 EPA\uc2  employees? Was that the subtext?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: I'm not saying. But they have to be. They have to be incredibly good mathematicians because they're trying to predict what will happen around the world if you're talking about climate change or locally with pollution. And nobody wants dirtier air for their family. Nobody wants dirtier water. Nobody wants to live in a place that's fouled by activity, development, or otherwise. And so I think that the payoff, if you will, for science is that you win more cases than you lose. I don't think you can decree science and I also think that it is incredibly important to understand the motivations of people who are doing the science. So while I happen to know a lot of the scientists or did know them when I was head of the \uc2 EPA\uc2 , it was not unusual that scientists who were doing work funded by \uc2 EPA\uc2  came to very different conclusions and then had huge arguments about what the preponderance of evidence said.\par \par \uc2 And that is what the scientific process is. It's exactly that and so I don't think you can use fiats to dictate that process and I don't think you should.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And in terms of the input that again, someone running the \uc2 EPA\uc2  should get from those on the outside. Again, as someone who has both been on the inside and then has been\u8212\'20\'14not that you're holding regular meetings with \uc2 EPA\uc2 , but obviously, I'm sure there are folks from \uc2 Apple\uc2  who meet with them. Could you talk a little about that? Because we now look at the schedules of cabinet members as we have in the past and clearly, there are patterns that have emerged, whether you're talking about, again, the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  or the Interior Department where part of clearly the message we've gotten from the Trump administration and from top political appointees is they feel like the regulator community just didn't have as much access to the leadership of these agencies under the Obama administration.\par \par \uc2 Now, they're certainly making a huge effort to incorporate both their views and simply just sit down and talk with them, go to their board meetings. I'm just curious of, again, what was your approach to meeting folks in the past and how do you think you strike a balance between getting the input from say, the constituencies that an agency is regulating and the constituencies who are affected by some of the policies but might not be the actual folks who are being regulated financially?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: You have to hear from all sides and I prided myself on hearing from all sides and I heard it from all sides and it wasn't unusual that everyone from the strong environmentalists to the proponents from some sector of industry would say, "You got it 100% wrong." And some people are nice about it and some people are darn rude about it, but that's the job. I did. I started at \uc2 EPA\uc2  almost 20 years before I became the administrator of the agency, and it is public service. It is public service and I cut my teeth at Superfund sites, where people would walk up to you in tears because their child was sick, and they were afraid it was something they had done or some negligence on their part because they gave them a bottle made with contaminated water. So the only other thing I'll say is that the rulemaking process is transparent for a reason. Every rule that's supposed to be put out is supposed to be put out for public comment and then it's adopted and then it's usually litigated, depending on the outcome of the rulemaking one way or the other.\par \par \uc2 Industry and groups that sort of live in this Washington bubble, they always have a voice. They have lawyers and trade associations that comment on rules all the time. The important thing is that the American people, sort of this body of people believe that the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2  is there as their advocate for clean and healthy communities and you can argue where that line needs to be but that's the role of the \uc2 Environmental Protection Agency\uc2 , and certainly, its leader.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: We have a question on \uc2 twitter\uc2  from Zane. "What are your thoughts on the term "greenwashing"? Is it a legitimate critique of global tech firms' \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  commitments?" To what extent do you think greenwashing exists and that's an issue?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: I think it's a great sounding name. I think it's cynical to some degree. I think the problem, though\u8212\'20\'14and I've always thought this\u8212\'20\'14is that the average consumer doesn't really have a way to understand who is really doing something that's meaningful and who talks a lot about it. And so at \uc2 Apple\uc2 , we try really hard not to put out a press release every day saying, "Look at all of the great things we're doing." But we do try to do them and then talk about them later. Actually, the one thing we're doing that is not like that is this whole circular economy with the robot and taking phones apart and trying to recycle. So I can understand why you might be a bit cynical, Zane, which is, "Are you really doing it?"\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And don't you think to some extent some other\u8212\'20\'14isn't that an accurate description of what some companies do?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Absolutely. You can think of companies right now whose commercials are all sunshine and tweeting birds but maybe not so much. And so I invite folks to go on our website, Apple.com/\b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and you can read our annual report, you can read our Supplier Responsibility report, you can read a report for every product we make, and you can see why I say that the carbon used for iPhone 8, aluminum is much less than iPhone 7 and iPhone 6. You can see all of those numbers. That's the best we can do, I think, but I think it's really important to do.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: We also have another question, which says, "Beyond \uc2 Apple\uc2 's direct efforts on sustainability, can you expand on the role of your supply chain in achieving climate goals?" And I think, again, people often like to hear the specifics. Can you show how you're working with suppliers to achieve what you're doing, given the fact that \uc2 Apple\uc2  has such an extensive network of suppliers?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yeah, so 77% of our carbon footprint is in\u8212\'20\'14of last year's carbon footprint. We haven't done it for this year\u8212\'20\'14is in our supply chain. So that means these are places that manufacture\u8212\'20\'14they may be mines, they may be a component manufacturer, they may do something\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And what's the breakdown? And I don't know if you know this off the top of your head. What breakdown is domestic and what breakdown is overseas?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Most of the carbon emissions are overseas, but we definitely have in our top 200 suppliers\u8212\'20\'14I can't remember the number right here sitting, but we have a huge part of our supply chain\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Is domestic?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Our component manufacturers, the covered glass is the one I like to use, with \uc2 Corning\uc2 . So 77% of the supply chain. So now, you have to get that supply chain to move to clean energy. Some people would say, "Well, if they don't use clean energy, take them out of your supply chain." There are two problems with that. No one's using it yet, and so you have no supply chain and that's a problem. But more importantly, if \uc2 Apple\uc2  stands for anything, it should be moving the supply chain leadership and what we find is a lot of what the supply chain energy managers need is help. They don't have a staff of engineers and an energy department like \uc2 Apple\uc2  does and consultants who can help them find deals. So our program consists of two things: mainly, technical support and a web portal, where our teams go out and spend tons of time with suppliers trying to help them move to clean energy. To be honest, most of our suppliers in the U.S. don't need the help. We're talking about certainly in Asia but other suppliers around the world who need to understand, "How do I access clean energy in my country? I can't just plug into a clean grid." And then we also have done\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And are there stories that come to mind of here, whether it's in Asia or Africa or Europe where you were able to connect a supplier and what does that look like?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: It looks like wanting to give all the credit to them because you want that moment when sort of they get the trophy, but we have several suppliers in China who we have scouted the deals and helped them understand and said, "Here's the investment you would have to make. Here's us assuring you that the energy will actually make it onto the grid so that it's offsetting the energy you're pulling from the grid." We also did 485-megawatts of clean energy ourselves in China as a downpayment for our supply chain so that they could\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And was that solar or what kind of energy was it?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yeah, solar. Actually, we have one wind deal. Two as well. So solar and wind, but the idea is a little bit of do it, show somebody, teach somebody how to fish and then at some point, say, "Hey, we're actually going to start favoring suppliers whose carbon footprints are lower. That will be one of the ways we evaluate you. We're not doing it yet because we want to help you get there but the time is coming."\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And do you have a year where you're hoping to achieve 100% renewable with suppliers or is that not fixed in stone?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yeah, we haven't announced a year for that. We announced 4-gigawatts of new clean energy in our supply chain by 2020. We did that two years ago and we already have 2.8-gigawatts under contract and don't quite quote me on that number, but over 1.5 already built. So we have a couple of more years but, of course, we want to finish early and so that 4-gigawatts would be a significant step in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Well, obviously, we're mainly talking about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  in this context, but you have social initiatives as part of your portfolio as well.\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and again, what is the role of a company like \uc2 Apple\uc2  when it comes to social policy and having an impact on these issues, whether it's connecting low-income communities with technology or other things. What is the role that \uc2 Apple\uc2  aspires to play and how do you execute that?\par \par \uc2 Jackson: I was really drawn to \uc2 Apple\uc2  because of our CEO, \uc2 Tim Cook\uc2  and Tim says that companies should have values. Companies are made of people and they should stand for something in the world. So forever, I think \uc2 Apple\uc2  stands for making products that are amazing, the best products in the world. They work, they work well and they're empowering products. They connect you. They enable you. You get the product and you decide what to do with it. But he's been really very vocal about saying, "But we also stand for fighting climate change and living up to and being an environmental leader." We also stand for education and that's mainly because our products are often used in education but because our roots were the idea that a product like a computer; a Mac could change somebody's outcome and really give them the power to learn and really move forward. We also stand for accessibility, meaning our products, when you think of them; most of them are smooth sheets of glass. Think about someone who is blind or someone who has other motor skill issues and they're thinking, "How does that work for me?" And so one in seven people on the planet have a disability and if you don't have one now, you'll probably get one as you age. And so our products have software that's built in and are widely seen as the most advanced in the world from the standpoint of people with disabilities; blind, deaf, motor disabilities, but also, developmental or learning disabilities. I'm really, really proud of that as well.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: And we're clearly at a moment, and this is in Washington and in Silicon Valley and Hollywood and elsewhere where the issue of women in the workforce in terms of whether it's sexual harassment, opportunities kind of coming up and kind of the tenor of the conversation has changed in recent weeks and I'm curious\u8212\'20\'14again, Silicon Valley has repeatedly come up as one of these communities that broadly is progressive but there have been real challenges for women getting ahead. Could you just, in closing, talk just a little about how \uc2 Apple\uc2  is tackling that or what does that conversation look like for\u8212\'20\'14[OVERLAPPING]\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yeah, Tim's been clear that he thinks women are the future of \uc2 Apple\uc2  because we need the diversity of approaches that happen when your workforce reflects the world. It's racial diversity, it's gender diversity. And we're really proud of the fact that if you look at sort of the folks we're hiring in; much more diverse than folks who have been at \uc2 Apple\uc2  for a long time.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: But I imagine on the senior level, it's still significantly\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Jackson: Yeah, although, if you take a look at our senior leadership page, we just hired a new general counsel, Kate Adams. The new head of People, a woman. A new head, a managing director for China, a woman engineer. So I think Tim is personally committed to leading by example and I think we're going to continue to do that but also, to do it in a way that values the employees we have. So there is no moment when you suddenly wake up and it's just, "Ta-da. It has happened." You have to respect the fact that the company, which has a really strong culture, is going to change over time.\par \par \uc2 Eilperin: Well, Lisa, unfortunately, that's all the time we have today. Thanks for joining us. And now I'd like to welcome my colleague Steven Stromberg to the stage for our next conversation. Thanks.\par \par \uc2 The Business of Sustainability:\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Good morning. I'm Steve Stromberg; I'm an editorial writer for The Washington Post. With me on stage to discuss the relationship between the private sector, consumers and sustainable business practices, I have \uc2 Syd Kitson\uc2 . He's chairman and CEO of Kitson & Partners, a former NFL player, who now oversees a 17,000-acre solar town called Babcock Ranch in southwest Florida. Next, we have Sophia Mendelsohn. She's the head of sustainability at \uc2 JetBlue Airways\uc2 . And lastly, we have\u8212\'20\'14but not least\u8212\'20\'14we have Malcolm Woolf, senior vice president for polity and government affairs, at Advanced Energy Economy, a DC-based national association of business leaders working to benefit advanced energy companies. And a quick reminder to everybody\u8212\'20\'14you can tweet for our panelists using #WorldInBalance or you can post your own comments to the comments on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  Live. I will try to take a few of those throughout our discussion. So, welcome.\par \par \uc2 I think we're entering a period when the government\u8212\'20\'14or at least the federal government\u8212\'20\'14seems sort of determined to do less to mandate environmentally-sound business operations, which means it arguably, then, falls on businesses themselves to decide what they owe to society at large, as they also seek to make a profit. So, why don't we start with a question that sounds pretty basic. Is there such a thing as corporate responsibility, at least outside of seeking profit and satisfying corporate owners? To what extent are companies responsible to society at large? Only to the extent that doing good encourages consumers to continue to buy, or beyond that? So, whichever one of you wants to start with that really easy question.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: I think it's a question of time frame. So, your first question is, what is the purpose of us trying to\u8212\'20\'14quote\u8212\'20\'14do good while making a buck? And, if it's a quarter-to-quarter view, and you're a short-term investor, the argument is arguably harder, especially if you have a longer ROI. Luckily, most of us are in business for the long run. We've built things; we want to establish reputations. The top Fortune 50 companies, multiple have been around for a hundred years; that's what CEOs envision.\par \par \uc2 So, we have the opportunity here to fight short-termism, and really sell up the food chain to boards, to investors, that sustainability is another word for long-term smart investment.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: And, what's been your experience at \uc2 JetBlue\uc2 ? Has it been a struggle to convince your bosses and your boards that the long-term view is the view they should be taking?\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: We're a publicly listed company, so we have a quarter-to-quarter calls and I think that answers the question to a certain extent. The more social pressure there and the more expectations there are from consumers to behave in a certain way, the more it helps folks like me make a long-term argument without necessarily waiting for the regulation and needing to rely on the fear of regulations, carrot and stick.\par \par \uc2 Kitson: I don't think there's any question that there's a responsibility to the private sector. And it is good business. And it is important to take a long view. Now, that's easy for me to say, because I'm in the private sector. When we first took a look at Babcock Ranch, it was a 91,000-acre ranch; that's 143 square miles. And we sold 73,000 acres to the State of Florida and Lee County, and the largest land purchase in the history of the state. And then we ended up with 18,000 acres. And of that 18,000 acres, we're preserving half of that.\par \par \uc2 So, at the end of the day, 90% of the original ranch\u8212\'20\'14Babcock Ranch\u8212\'20\'14is in preservation forever. And that's a legacy that people are going to be able to enjoy for generations, and we think that's very, very important.\par \par \uc2 And then we ended up with this basically 9,000 acres, and we're building a new town, but a very sustainable town. And we think it's good business. So, when we started planning our new town, we went back 40 years and looked at plans to see how the natural flow-ways through this property kind of worked their way through, and that's how we designed it. And we designed it on land that has already been disturbed.\par \par \uc2 And so, when you think about what you can do from the private sector and make it profitable, we believe it's great business\u8212\'20\'14A\u8212\'20\'14but B\u8212\'20\'14it's the right thing to do. We have issues that we have to address as a society, and we think it's our responsibility to do that. So, it's very exciting to us. And one of the things that we talked about, the first solar town\u8212\'20\'14one of our first initiatives was to say, how do we deal with the energy? We're going to have almost 20,000 homes and 6 million people\u8212\'20\'14I mean, 6 million square feet of commercial space.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: I was going to say, that's a lot of people. [LAUGHTER]\par \par \uc2 Woolf: Yeah, I was going to say\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Kitson: That's more like a China city, but\u8212\'20\'14no, it's going to be about 50,000 people. But energy was the key for us. So, we spent almost nine years of time. We actually made the announcement here in Washington, D.C., that we were going to become the first solar-powered town in America. And \uc2 Florida Power and Light\uc2  has built a 75-megawatt solar power generating facility right on our property. It's there today; we donated the 440 acres. They've installed 343,000 panels. So, when you're at Babcock Ranch today and you look at the light in our town, it's powered by solar energy, and at night, the natural gas then kicks in, and it's part of our natural gas.\par \par \uc2 So, the combination of those two make it the cleanest form of energy of anywhere in the country, but the next step is storage. How do we take this to a whole other level? And if we can store the energy and not be on the grid, then we've really, really accomplished something, and that's where we're headed towards. But that's good business.\par \par \uc2 And just one quick story. We had an event where we said, "Come see our progress at Babcock Ranch," and\u8212\'20\'14because everything was under construction, and people wanted to see what was going on there\u8212\'20\'14and we were hoping a couple thousand people would show up. That's a lot of people, a couple thousand people coming in to see what you're doing. Well, 20,000 people came to see what was going on at Babcock Ranch, and every single person there was asking, "We want to see the solar. We want to see what's going on with the solar." So, \uc2 Florida Power and Light\uc2  has agreed to build an observatory so people can actually see the scale of this.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: They want to see the plant itself?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: They wanted to see what it was all about, and how it actually worked, and they were very\u8212\'20\'14and so, Florida Power has put a kiosk in to explain how it works, and then they're going to have an observation tower so people can actually see really what the scale of what they're doing.\par \par \uc2 Woolf: Huh. I think what this conversation has already shown is that sustainability might have been leading-edge 20 years ago. It's pretty mainstream today.\par \par \uc2 Kitson: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 Woolf: I think it's been embraced by corporate America. In fact, 71% of Fortune 100 companies have specific numeric renewable greenhouse gas targets that they've committed to achieve. They're accountable to their board and shareholders to achieve that. When you go to the Fortune 500, it's over 43%, and growing. So, this is already pretty mainstream with the large companies. I think it's growing down to even the smaller-sized companies. And when you look at the size of the advanced energy industry, the clean tech industry that powers our economy\u8212\'20\'14this is not a future industry; this is a current big business, a $200 billion U.S. industry, over three million jobs, roughly the size of retail, and growing three times faster than the U.S. economy, when you don't count ethanol.\par \par \uc2 So, this is a fast growing, already existing industry, which just underscores that sustainability is now mainstream, in at least corporate America.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: And just to be clear, the advanced energy economy is\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Woolf: So, we're all forms of kind of cutting-edge advanced technology. So, it's the renewable guys\u8212\'20\'14winds, solar, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, fast-acting natural gas, modular nuclear reactors\u8212\'20\'14all the forms of technologies that may not have been competitive 20 years ago, but are competitive and being deployed today.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: And are you feeling demand for this sort of sustainability from shareholders, boards? I mean, is it across the board, or is there within kind of corporate structures, there are some who seem to be more interested than others. Can you detect a pattern?\par \par \uc2 Woolf: Sure. I think there is a pattern, certainly. The larger companies, more sophisticated companies a long time ago started this; they were the tip of the spear. \uc2 Walmart\uc2 , for example, announced their sustainability goals\u8212\'20\'14100% renewable energy commitment\u8212\'20\'14in 2005. You know, that was a different administration, a different time. This is not a fad that comes and goes with the political administration. This is a long-term commitment, and that has not progressed much beyond kind of those leading companies to be mainstream.\par \par \uc2 And I think there's a few reasons why they do it. First of all, it's economic now. There's not necessarily a cost. You can sign wind contracts at two and a half cents a kilowatt hour; solar is coming down below four cents; energy efficiency utilities are doing it at about four cents. So, there's not a price premium you have to pay; you just have to ask the question.\par \par \uc2 And there's a real social value that corporations have. They're part of their communities; they want to sponsor the Little League team. They also want to have a sustainability commitment to show that they're good stewards. And increasingly\u8212\'20\'14at least what I'm hearing from our members\u8212\'20\'14is that they're asked about it. They're asked about it by their employees. Millennials want to work for a company that they feel good about. And they're being asked about it by shareholders.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Sophia, you're nodding your head a lot.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: I agree. And I think this is a perfect example of what we're really dealing with is the hangover from the reputation that sustainability and environmental social governance used to have. And it's like, 10 years ago that was true. But it takes a long time for society to move on with a conversation. And so, we come to conversations like this and we're still starting it by saying, "This is good business." When I go to a finance conversation, we don't start it saying, "Making money is good business," and, "We should have lots of different people doing it, regardless of the administration."\par \par \uc2 So, the sooner we put that conversation aside, the better, and I think one of the many ways that that change is happening is by having small, medium enterprises begin to take the message to their consumers, so it's not just the top brand value\u8212\'20\'14\uc2 JetBlue\uc2 , \uc2 Disney\uc2 , \uc2 Coca-Cola\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14saying, "We have to do this to protect our reputation with consumers." It's beginning to be woven into society.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: On consumers\u8212\'20\'14because I think this is a fascinating question of when do they care? When do consumers care? It actually surprised me a little bit when you mentioned the interest in solar, because I would have assumed at Babcock Ranch the real appeal of the sustainability that you have built into the development is you have nature around; you have trails; you have shining sun and animals and green, right? It surprised me that there would be that much interest in the solar generation per se.\par \par \uc2 So, but more broadly to all of you, when do consumers care? I mean, do they care whether the \uc2 Starbucks\uc2  in their local strip mall has a green roof? Do they notice that? Do they care that the cups have recycling labels on them? Do they care when they're informed that the coffee beans come from a sustainable agricultural practice? Are there circumstances in which consumers seem to care more about sustainability? And if so, how do you either cultivate those circumstances, or expand the customers' sort of conscientiousness?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: I think they absolutely care, and what's interesting, it's not just the Millennials, but it's the Baby Boomers. I think both really care about what we're doing as a society, and one thing people equate it to. It's, first of all, cost is a big issue. We really need to think about\u8212\'20\'14the way we term it is, better quality at a lower cost. And so, money does matter, and what comes out of the pocketbooks do matter. And as much as people want to be sustainable, it still has to make economic sense for them individually.\par \par \uc2 Also, it's proven that if you live in a healthy \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , you're going to live longer. That's absolutely a proven fact. So, I think people think about that also. So, when you start to put all these things together, from a consumer perspective, it's not only accepted right now, but people are seeking it. They're looking for that type of a lifestyle. And from a product perspective, and from what we're doing from a more of a community perspective.\par \par \uc2 I read a lot about how everybody's talking about building these smart cities, and we're already doing that. All those things that people have talked about, whether\u8212\'20\'14how we talk about the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u8212\'20\'14on the education side, we started with a school. We didn't have anybody living there, and we started with the school, and it's amazing how that filled up almost instantly. We have our solar energy.\par \par \uc2 Our transportation is going to be with autonomous vehicles. We actually are starting next month with an autonomous shuttle, an electrically-powered autonomous shuttle. So think about this: we have autonomous vehicles that are powered by solar energy, and it's transporting people from point to point, and the whole idea here is, what we're hoping is people right now basically have two cars in their garage. We think very shortly people are going to be looking at one car in their garage. And then, shortly after that\u8212\'20\'14we hope within the next ten years\u8212\'20\'14they say, "Wait a minute. We don't need any cars in our garage."\par \par \uc2 And think about the societal benefits, and what that does to\u8212\'20\'14not only for consumers, but for our landscapes and just for society in general\u8212\'20\'14the societal benefits are absolutely incredible. We're doing that right now at Babcock Ranch.\par \par \uc2 And so, health and wellness, really then, ties into everything you were talking about, with the trails, and we have occupational therapy and physical therapy and eating well. Everything is farm to table. Those things people really care about. When they come in and they know that our restaurant is farm to table, they talk about it, and they come back, and they come back, and enjoy it. So, those things\u8212\'20\'14the sustainable part of what we're doing\u8212\'20\'14is selling homes, and it is something that in our mind is very economically feasible.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Um-hm. So, you started off by talking about how, sort of the obvious point, consumers are cost-sensitive, right?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: Absolutely.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: At the same time, you seem to be saying that they're a sort of sustainability premium that people are willing to pay. Is that what you're saying? And is there sort of a balance that you have to establish between the two? I toured this sort of smart solar-powered town and model city over in Japan last year, and everything was gleaming and very efficient, and very nice and new. Except it was a little expensive. So, how do you compete against the non-sustainable developers?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: I think you have to make it economically feasible for the consumer. And so, I think those are very, very important. Again, better quality at a lower cost. So, everything we're doing, we look at how can this\u8212\'20\'14whether it be autonomous vehicles, or how people are living their lives in their homes. The availability of the trails, and giving people a choice.\par \par \uc2 But we're looking at keeping those prices down. I don't think they're mutually exclusive. I don't think just because it's sustainable\u8212\'20\'14just because you're doing it the right way\u8212\'20\'14means it needs to be more expensive. And we're proving that out. It really doesn't, even how you build homes. Part of the issue is\u8212\'20\'14we're greenfield, so we're coming out of the ground right now. On the technology side, we have a gigabit to every, single home, fiber to every, single home\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: This is internet access?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: Exactly. So, when you have that kind of speed, if you were trying to do that in other towns, you're digging up lawns and creating all kinds of havoc, and it's very, very expensive. So, in a brownfield situation it might be a little bit more expensive. But I the greenfield, doing these things the right way from the beginning is very important.\par \par \uc2 And if you're in Florida\u8212\'20\'14anybody here from Florida\u8212\'20\'14you'll know that we have a thousand people a day moving into our state net. We need to accommodate that, and we need to do it in the right way. And so, if you think about doing it the right way from the beginning, those costs aren't nearly as onerous as you think they are.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Malcolm, I think you have something to say?\par \par \uc2 Woolf: Sure. Just going back to your earlier question, I think business is really following demand here. The demand is there, which is why they're responding, whether it's Energy Star labels that customers want, or LEED-certified buildings that businesses want to keep their costs down\u8212\'20\'14there's a whole array of market signals that businesses are responding to, and they found that it doesn't cost more. That old concern about a price premium simply\u8212\'20\'14to talk about the housing example\u8212\'20\'14orientation of the house. You just frame the house, thinking about, "Hey, how is this going to be sustainable?" doesn't cost more to maybe turn it 15 degrees to get the kind of community you want.\par \par \uc2 So, I think folks are beginning to realize they don't have to choose between price and sustainability; they can get what they want and still be competitive. And if you don't do that, people are going to walk an extra block to go to the organic cleaners, or the more sustainable coffee shop.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Your second question exposes the weakness of your first question, your first question being, "Do they care?" and your second question immediately being, "But how much are they willing to pay for that?"\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Yeah.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Because the answer is\u8212\'20\'14universally, when we're done with all the nice stories\u8212\'20\'14is not very much more. And we sell all kinds of expensive things all the time\u8212\'20\'14like purses to women\u8212\'20\'14and people pay a lot for things, and it doesn't seem that that luxury premium will necessarily translate to\u8212\'20\'14quote\u8212\'20\'14doing the right thing when you're walking to the cleaners or the grocery store.\par \par \uc2 So, for big companies, I think it's actually a straw man to ask if consumers care. And we should just be working with our current marketing structure, which is very well established at all of these companies, and say, "Why do people buy our products in the first place? Okay, yeah. They want to get somewhere?" Because they want to feel good about themselves. They're always going to care about that. That's the basic marketing question.\par \par \uc2 So, rather than asking them to care about something esoteric and special and far-off and distant that they still learn about, just ask to care about themselves\u8212\'20\'14like they have been the whole time\u8212\'20\'14and let me work within the product\u8212\'20\'14much like Lisa was saying\u8212\'20\'14to change the supply chain so they don't even have to think about it, just feel good with the brand.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: I have a question from Savannah on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . "Sophia mentioned that companies will be more likely influenced to be more sustainable when the public expects and demands it. How can consumers best voice their desire for more sustainable practices within companies?"\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: There are two ways. One is, your individual purchasing power, which is now greater than ever, with the microphone of social media. And the other way is as an investor. Individuals are the ones behind the banks. It's us saving our money for the long-term for our long-term goals. Tell your company who manages your 401k; tell your money managers and your mutual funds that you want them to be looking out for your money in the long run, that you didn't put this money away and save it to use tomorrow; it's for in 50 years, so you'd like it to be with a company that can at least think out 50 years.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: When we think about sustainability, we often think about sort of wind turbines on the horizon, or solar farms with an observation deck. But arguably, more important is driving efficiency. So, what are you trying to use less of in your various spheres, and how are you doing it? Who wants to go first?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: I'll take a quick stab at it. As an example, water is very precious, and so we have our own water treatment facility. But, everything in the entire community is irrigated with reuse water to replenish the aquifers and to make sure that\u8212\'20\'14again, thinking about sustainability and the long term\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: And by reuse water, you mean you collect everything that\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Kitson: Absolutely, it comes back in and goes right back out. But there are other\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Do you have on-site water treatment to do that?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: Yes. That we own and we operate, and have made sure that it's done in an appropriate way. I think some of the other things, too, are in design. So, when you pull into Babcock Ranch, you're not going to see a lot of grass. You're going to see natural areas along the boulevards. And therefore, you don't have all of the leaf blowers and the lawn mowers and everything else constantly burning, and spending the time mowing those areas. Instead, they're natural. People love it. They go, "Well, why don't we just always have this?" because they're beautiful areas.\par \par \uc2 And the other thing we've done is used natural, native plant materials. One of the things down in Florida, we do have wind events every now and then. And so, the things that survive are generally native, native plant materials. So, and not only are they native, but they require less water. So, we have committed to making sure that we restrict the amount of turf that people allowed on their homes and that the majority of all of the landscaping has to be native plant materials. That's just one example.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: That type of thinking from a CEO, a decision maker, at that level is exactly what we need with the Fortune 500s. And again, it goes to long-term versus short-termism. \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  has a great statistic where they interviewed a couple hundred CFOs, and 50% of the CFOs said they would forego investing in a smart project in their supply chain that saved money, saved fuel, et cetera, if it meant they were going to miss quarterly earnings by a penny.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Hm. Wow.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: That's the pressure that is put upon large public companies, which is allowing small private companies to move in a way that we necessarily can't.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Yeah, that's interesting.\par \par \uc2 Woolf: The cheapest next kilowatt of power is the one that's not needed, so there's all sorts of ways that companies, individuals can reduce their energy consumption, but you deal with that short-term thinking. When you go to an LED lightbulb, the payback period is a matter of months, but there is that upfront cost. So, you've got to get past that. And I think increasingly more and more of the market is, and that's driving the systematic change.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: Malcolm, you've been working with major companies to buy renewable electricity, advanced electricity of all types. It might sound strange, but, you've also sort of criticized government regulation at times as a barrier to doing this. Would you please explain when the government helps and when it hurts sustainability efforts?\par \par \uc2 Woolf: Sure. Advanced Energy Economy has actually created an advanced energy buyers' group for large corporate buyers who have their sustainability goals, but they're finding it difficult and far harder than it should be to do so. So, for example, if you're a business in North Carolina and you want to lease your roofs for solar, you don't want to get into the solar business, but you want solar panels on your roof\u8212\'20\'14you can't do that. That's illegal. In another half of the country, if you want to sign a deal for wind power, you're not allowed to. You can only buy what you're regulated utility allows you to buy.\par \par \uc2 So, I think there are a whole array of areas where regulation has gotten in the way. The industry is not asking for mandates or subsidies\u8212\'20\'14we may have needed that 20 years ago\u8212\'20\'14we are competitive today. What we want is the market to work. And there are propels out there now to subsidize uneconomic coal and nuclear plants, which we think is a troubling development. There's other proposals to impose tariffs on solar panels, to change the tax code and change the existing phase-outs of these subsidies, which is going to disrupt the markets.\par \par \uc2 All we want now is, leave us alone and let us complete. Let markets work.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: You have also said that the federal government is sort of deferring to states more often now on sustainability questions; but, that a lot of the states don't really know what to do. As a former state energy official yourself, are there some that are sort of getting it right and others that are getting it wrong? Or is there kind of a\u8212\'20\'14are we universally at sea here?\par \par \uc2 Woolf: I think there's a fundamental change that's happening in the electricity world that's going to take some time. But, one state that I think is doing it well is New York. And just to shar a quick example, in Brooklyn\u8212\'20\'14I understand Brooklyn has become hip and cool again, and Millennials are moving in, so it's one area in the northeast where there's load growth. And to upgrade a transformer, which would be needed to meet that growth, would cost north of a billion dollars. A billion dollars.\par \par \uc2 So, the regulators decided an innovative approach. Rather than simply allow the billion-dollar upgrade and charge rate payers, they challenged the utility to spend $200 million and see if they could solve the problem. And instead of saying, "Do it by upgrading the substation," they said, "Find a solution. Go out to the market for solutions. Don't pick a technology." And the market responded. Between energy efficiency and solar and storage, they are going to be able to solve that problem for $200 million instead of a billion.\par \par \uc2 But now, look at it from the utility's perspective. Right now, they get a rate of return on how much money they spend. So, if they spend a billion dollars, they get a rate of return on that, versus $200 million. So, New York is trying to change the incentives, so that you can incent industry to make money by doing the things that's right for rate payers.\par \par \uc2 And so, that kind of change\u8212\'20\'14there are a few leading states\u8212\'20\'14Rhode Island, Massachusetts, actually, Minnesota, Hawaii\u8212\'20\'14there are a number of states that are looking at how do we evolve the utility business model to get what we want for cheaper?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: You know, it's been interesting. We've been very fortunate working with \uc2 Florida Power and Light\uc2  in Florida, and they've been very progressive in thinking about renewable energy, and how they can further it in the state. I mean, they've really taken a lead in building multiple 75-megawatt solar farms throughout the state. And then, what's really been interesting\u8212\'20\'14and not everybody wants to hear this necessarily, but\u8212\'20\'14they've been challenging us about how they can be more sustainable, and how they can get the word out about every time that they drive their car, what it means, versus if they're solar-powered. And letting people truly understand what it is we're trying to do, and\u8212\'20\'14whether it be storage, which is hopefully the next level for us at Babcock Ranch\u8212\'20\'14we're very engaged with them to try and take that to a next step.\par \par \uc2 So, there's a large company that is really looking at sustainability, and they're passionate about it, and how they can take that to a whole new level.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: We have Ben on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , who asks: Sustainable purchasing options seem mostly readily available for middle and upper classes. How can, or do, sustainability efforts of private industry reach those of lower economic standing with less purchasing power?\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Well, Ben, I'd say that's a great question that's been solved already, \uc2 Walmart\uc2  being a perfect example of a very accessible brand, set of goods that have solved this problem, or are solving this problem for the consumer so that you don't have to care about it, just like we don't ask you to care about any other internal workings of the company.\par \par \uc2 And as \uc2 JetBlue\uc2  is New York's hometown airline, and I'm a young, hip, Millennial, so I'm glad\u8212\'20\'14yeah, in Brooklyn\u8212\'20\'14so, I'm glad to hear that. But again, it really\u8212\'20\'14I'm sorry, the question that you were originally answer about\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: The kind of states that are trying to lead the way in this effort.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Yeah. Thank you. The success stories here are all because this has been depoliticized. And it's been depoliticized through the common sense of money. And so if there's one message for this room, one tone we could take away\u8212\'20\'14that, if we leave this in the hands of business, we will be able to handle it logically.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: We probably have time for one more question from \uc2 Twitter\uc2  here, from Isabelle, who asks Syd: Was Babcock affected by the recent hurricane? If not, how does the ranch's vulnerability to climate change and weather disasters factor into their operations and sustainability plans?\par \par \uc2 You mentioned this a little bit already, but is there any more?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: That is such a great question. So, Babcock Ranch is 30 feet above sea level. And we're well above the storm surge.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Is that a lot?\par \par \uc2 Kitson: In Florida, that's a virtual mountain.\par \par \uc2 Mendelsohn: Okay. [LAUGHTER]\par \par \uc2 Kitson: And so, we're above the storm surge. We didn't build in any wetlands. We're not building in any flood plains. And we've hardened the community. So, thank you for asking that question, because the eye of the hurricane went right over the top of us. And by the way, all of our utilities are buried underground and everything we do, we think about that resilience, so that people don't have to leave; they don't have to evacuate if, in fact, there's a storm in Florida.\par \par \uc2 And so, I think the responsible thing we should be thinking about is where we build. Sometimes\u8212\'20\'14and people don't like to hear this\u8212\'20\'14but, if we're building in flood plains, and we're building in those wetlands and those low-lying areas, and there's a storm, there's going to be damage, and then we're all going to have to pay for that, and that's consistently what happens.\par \par \uc2 What we're doing at Babcock Ranch is a totally different model, where we're well above the storm surge, and because we're hardening the construction, it's really safe for people. They don't have to worry about jumping into the car and getting out and finding a safer area. People are going to be coming to our community to be in a safe area.\par \par \uc2 And there are so many lessons learned through Hurricane Irma, and we're going to take those lessons and continue to improve. But the eye of the storm came right over the top of us, and I would say within two days later, you would not have known that Babcock Ranch was hit by a hurricane.\par \par \uc2 Stromberg: The National Flood Insurance Program thanks you. [LAUGHTER]\par \par \uc2 Panelists, that's all the time we have. Thanks for joining us and sharing your expertise.\par \par \uc2 Before the next panel comes to call your attention to the screen. The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  spoke with two people who are leading efforts in Puerto Rico and \uc2 Patagonia\uc2  and working hard to make progress on sustainability and conservation across the world. Here's a look at what they're doing right now.\par \par \uc2 Moving Toward Environmental Equality:\par \par \uc2 Fears: Hello, everyone. I'm Darryl Fears. I'm a national environmental reporter for The Washington Post and for our final segment today, we're going to be talking about environmental quality and efforts to promote environmental standards, and justice in the United States and across the world. And with me to talk about this are Catherine Coleman Flowers, founder of the Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise Community Development corporation, which seeks to address the root causes of poverty by seeking sustainable solutions. Dune Ives, executive director of the Lonely Whale, an organization that works across public and private sectors to promote market-based and policy change to help reduce ocean waste. And finally, Brendan Shane, regional director for North America, C40 Cities climate leadership group, where he supports C40 cities in the United States and Canada, in their climate action and sustainability initiatives, and facilitates inner city, regional, and global collaboration.\par \par \uc2 Just a reminder to tweet your question for our panelist at #WorldInBalance, and we'll take a few of those during the conversation. Panelists, that's all\u8212\'20\'14oops, I'm sorry. Okay, so let's get that conversation started. I'd like to ask if there's anything opening\u8212\'20\'14a statement that any of you would like to say about this issue in your part of the world.\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, I can start. Being from Alabama, thank you for this opportunity to be able to present and talk about environmental justice. I work in a community that's located between Selma and Montgomery, and there, as we talk about dealing with environmental issues, people there still don't have the basic right to sanitation. When they flush their toilets, it's either going out on the ground, or it's coming back into their homes, and we need to address that in this country. We partnered with Baylor's National School of Tropical Medicine, and did a study that revealed that\u8212\'20\'14where we found evidence of hookworm and other tropical parasites here in the United States of America.\par \par \uc2 And I believe that that's an atrocity at this particular day and time, and especially when there's discussion around ending the efforts of the \uc2 EPA\uc2 , and other kinds of efforts around climate, and here we have the perfect marriage of environmental justice and climate change, where we're starting to see tropical illnesses that normally are not seen in the United States, but because the climate is in fact changing, people are being exposed to that, and it's going to be\u8212\'20\'14and they're going to move further north. But these are infrastructure issues that we need to address in rural communities, that have never been addressed.\par \par \uc2 Fears: And Catherine, how unusual is it to see a widespread case of hookworm in these communities in this day and time?\par \par \uc2 Flowers: It's very unusual. Actually, if you look at the literature, the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission takes credit for eliminating this in the first part of the last century, and we're talking about 2017. And we see evidence of it, so much so that it is garnered international attention, that here in the United States of America, where we have one of the richest and most robust economies in the world, there are a lot of people who have been left out.\par \par \uc2 So, as we talk about how we build sustainability, we need to first of all look at those communities that we've left out, and have never addressed these issues in the first place, because I want to bring solar power to my community, but I also want to make sure that they're not on homes that are energy inefficient\u8212\'20\'14mobile homes, that people living in don't even gain value.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Speaking of waste, Dune, how much of our garbage winds up in the ocean? How much plastic is out there, and what can we do to sort of start mitigating that?\par \par \uc2 Ives: Well, at the risk of being the bad news panel here today\u8212\'20\'14and thank you for having me on the panel this morning. It's really a pleasure to be here with all of you. Every year, we produce 300 million metric tons of new plastic. Only 10% of that is recycled. About 78% of that becomes waste. A lot of that actually ends up into the ocean, either through rivers and lakes as part of oceanic, or directly into the ocean itself. So, we know that annually, between 8 and 12 million metric tons of plastic is making its way into the ocean.\par \par \uc2 Once it's in the ocean, it's nearly impossible to extract it. A lot of plastic is breaking down into what's called microplastics; straws, cups, lids, plastic bags. There's a lot of low value plastics, they're called, that don't have an end of life market presently available to them, to be able to be purchased, but they break up into microplastics, and they become really attractive to fish. They are ingested by\u8212\'20\'14and the estimate right now is 100% of all seven species of turtles ingest plastic. Many of them become entangled by plastic, as well, so it's pervasive.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Right. I recently wrote a story about plastics, and of the 9 billion tons of plastics produced in the world since the invention of plastics around 1950, 7 billion tons still exist. And so, we've only gotten rid of 2 billion tons of plastic. The stuff stays around forever. There is a campaign to do little things, like eliminate straws and stuff like that, because a straw got stuck in a turtle's nose. Can you tell us a little more about the danger that these plastics pose to these animals, and what's happening out there with them?\par \par \uc2 Ives: Yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. So, the estimate right now is when an animal ingests plastic, it has a 50% mortality rate. Straws, bags, I think everybody has seen the video of the turtle with the straw in its nose. It's heartbreaking. We recently received a photo of a fish from Indonesia that had a straw in its belly and a chip bag, and a biodegradable plastic spoon. Plastic bags are showing up in the bellies of whales. These animals can't recover, and it's our waste that's causing it. I think also important, and I love what Governor Schwarzenegger recently said from COP23 when he said, "We have to start talking about these environmental issues in a different way. We have to think about it in terms of our human health," and that's where we get back to the environmental justice conversation. Plastic pollution impacts us as a species.\par \par \uc2 94% of our drinking water in the United States is polluted with plastic. That should scare us, that we're drinking plastic. We know plastic fibers are showing up in the flesh of fish. When the vast majority of the world's population relies on marine-based protein as their primary source of protein, that's injustice. So, it is harmful to animals. I think we're only now beginning to see what the potential impact is to us as species, and as a mother of a three-year old, I no longer serve my child fish sticks.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Brendan, you do important work that few people understand, and few people know about. So, why don't you start by explaining to us what a C40 city is, and exactly what it is that you do.\par \par \uc2 Shane: Yeah. Well, we are a network actually not of 40 anymore, but of 91 of the largest cities in the world. So, that's about 650 million people, and a large chunk\u8212\'20\'14about a quarter of the world's GDP. So, these are the mayors in all parts of the world that are most dedicated to pushing for climate change action. But I think to follow on the comments you just heard, what these mayors really want to do is improve the health, the sanitation, the air quality, the delivery of services for their constituents, whether it's in Africa, Asia, or here in the United States.\par \par \uc2 And so, we are a climate-focused organization, but much of the emphasis we have right now is looking at what's the nexus between the equity outcomes, the improving inclusion and inequity in communities, that you see with the same type of actions we need to take for climate protection, whether it's solar, whether it's better water resource management, and in particular, whether it's waste management. Our cities, not to cast dispersions, but the waste you're referring to is coming, in large part, from our cities, and much of that from southeast China, from the Philippines, from cities\u8212\'20\'14and they're taking these issues very seriously. And so, our role is bringing the mayors together, bringing the technical staff, NGOs, and partners together to try to tackle those with the best available solutions.\par \par \uc2 Fears: And so, what do we have in the way of results so far?\par \par \uc2 Shane: Well, they vary. These challenges are extremely difficult and so we see good progress in a number of communities; in, let's say, more developed cities. You see really rapid movement. We're going to see cities that are indeed carbon neutral; that are down to the point of no net emissions, in the next decade. And then in parts of the developing world, you see really strong advances around, let's say, mobility, in particular. Mobility\u8212\'20\'14just the ability to get around in cleaner transport that improves air quality and lets people live a healthier, better life.\par \par \uc2 So, but all those regions are challenged by any number of issues; air quality problems, even if your city in Europe is pushing hard toward a low-carbon economy, and no emissions, you're still getting polluted air. You're still eating fish out of polluted waters. So, the challenges keep rising, and that's sort of what we try to do. We call ourselves the climate leadership group, because we're trying to keep pushing hard on ourselves, on our own leaders to kind of keep upping the ante. You just saw it at COP23 this past week in Bonne, all the nations coming together and realizing what we've committed to so far is good, but it's not enough. And it's not enough for the climate, but it's also not enough for the oceans, or for sanitation and health of communities.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Catherine, you're representing people who are\u8212\'20\'14who have very little sort of resources, who are poor, who have very little representation and political power. And across the United States and of course, the world, you have these people living in the most vulnerable areas near shipping ports, near waste treatment facilities, near superfund sites\u8212\'20\'14toxic superfund sites\u8212\'20\'14because they don't have any power. And so, does the government have a responsibility to sort of rescue these people from this to create policies, and how do you get them to create these policies that sort of alleviate some of these problems in their communities?\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, first of all, I think that the government is a factor in some of these dirty industries that have located in these communities, because a lot of times, the government is providing incentives for them to locate there. And often times, they're left to the their own devices, and if they're poisoning the community, like in Uniontown, they're bringing in coal ash, the people there are suffering as a result.\par \par \uc2 Fears: How do those people fight this? What can you do to mobilize opposition?\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, a lot of people are organizing and trying to fight it. I think that one of the problems that we have in rural communities is that the major media doesn't\u8212\'20\'14is not interested in covering stories there. Fortunately, there's a lot of attention in Alabama right now. Hopefully, we can look at some of those other problems we have, too, so I think that's one thing, because there are groups that are organized throughout Alabama, I know for sure, and throughout the Gulf coast region. A lot of people that I\u8212\'20\'14when I go to Detroit, for an example, people are organizing there because they have water affordability issues, where people's homes are being taken because they can't afford the water bill. They put water mortgages on their homes.\par \par \uc2 So, these problems are happening around the country, and people are organizing. The problem is we don't get the media attention. And lastly, I think in terms of how we address the policies, we've been working with Senator Corey Booker on developing some EJ policies. This morning I had a meeting with a group here that's also working on that, as well.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Okay, I think we just got called out twice in one\u8212\'20\'14so, Dune, you're aware of some of the problems out there in the drinking water, and with plastics, but to a large degree, the very problems you talked about, people aren't generally aware of them. And it seems that it's easy to make them aware of it, but maybe I'm wrong about that. Are people aware? If they're not aware, how do you make them more aware that their children and themselves may be drinking these pollutants?\par \par \uc2 Ives: I'm fortunate to live in Seattle, Washington, and every day, I get to look out my window at the Puget Sound, and I see the water, and it looks beautiful. It's blue, and blue means good, right? It doesn't mean that it's polluted. I think ocean health issues are really difficult to solve for, because the ocean looks healthy. One, if we even recognize that there's an ocean, and we think about it, which the vast majority of us don't think about it on a daily basis. It covers the majority of our planet, but it's pretty far away from us, and it's pretty unattainable.\par \par \uc2 To be able to get on the water, in the water, requires means. And most of us don't have those means to be able to do it. So, you're right; people typically aren't aware that there is an ocean that has issues, so we're doing two things at Lonely Whale: one is we're incubating these courageous campaigns so our campaign we have right now is called Stop Sucking, and it's about single-use plastic straws. Every day in the United States, we use 500 million non-recyclable plastic straws. They're not all getting into the water, but a lot of them are, but it's really a token. It's that token item to say, we have a relationship, we have a toxic relationship with single-use plastics, and we need to break that relationship. It's effective in garnering attention and spreading the message. It's in over 40 countries already, which is exciting, but we also know that we need market-based solutions, and we need policy change to really support this awareness building, and the change that we need.\par \par \uc2 So, we're working really closely with \uc2 Dell\uc2 , based in Austin, Texas. \uc2 Dell\uc2 , in partnership with Lonely Whale, is launching a consortium of global enterprises, global companies, that together are trying to stand up. The first commercially viable and operational ocean-bound material supply chain, and in doing so, what they've committed to is integrating this waste product\u8212\'20\'14plastic bottles, bags, nylon material\u8212\'20\'14into their products and packaging. So, turning the faucet off while other companies are looking at recyclability and infrastructure development.\par \par \uc2 Dell\uc2 's leadership in this space cannot be understated. I love what you said about it really is the government allowing these companies to come in, and they do what they're going to do. Companies have the opportunity to take a very thoughtful leadership role on these environmental issues that we're dealing with. They have such leverage and such power to be able to influence within their own industry, but cross-industry, as well, so while those of us who are fighting the good fight on the ground, and raising awareness and building a global movement, we need the help of corporations like \uc2 Dell\uc2  to really push this forward, and I think what that does is it shows policy makers that the market is supportive of change. It becomes so much easier for policy to get put into place.\par \par \uc2 Fears: To bring this issue back to the audience, in this area, we're fortunate enough to have the Chesapeake Bay cleanup plan, which is ongoing, and going for the next ten years. But the Potomac River, where most of you get your water, has a little problem with male bass somehow becoming female bass, because of\u8212\'20\'14scientists think\u8212\'20\'14pollutants in the water, from chemicals from the stuff that many of you pour down the toilet, in the sink, that's affecting marine life there. So, the water sometimes isn't as pure here as you might think. So, Brendan\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Shane: Can I just pick up on the last comment?\par \par \uc2 Fears: You did last time, too.\par \par \uc2 Shane: Yeah, I think that in the waste context, but also in the climate context, and just to refer to the effort that was just a very strong effort at the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . negotiations from the United States, we are still in campaign, which was talking about the dedication of states and cities, to the Paris Accords, to pushing for climate change. What that really, I think, recognizes is just what Dune was referencing; that we were there working with cities, but it really is that combination of government, state and cities, counties, and tribes, but then it's the private sector. So, what you saw stepping up were thousands of companies, also universities, healthcare systems coming together because you have to\u8212\'20\'14those are the groups across\u8212\'20\'14or collectively, in particular, that can aggregate the demand to change the market the way you're describing, and that might be changing it to say we have to have the 100% renewable supply that \uc2 Lisa Jackson\uc2  was referring to, or that we need to see materials that are either biodegradable or fully recyclable, or maybe just we're not going to use those types of plastic products at all anymore. No more single-use for certain categories.\par \par \uc2 Ives: I think that's right. And I think we also\u8212\'20\'14there's some really local issues that are very present, especially for the work you're doing in Alabama and with C40, C91\u8212\'20\'14you going to rebrand? C40, and there is a really important role for the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . to play in these conversations. The sustainable development goals give us a marker that we can work towards, so we work very closely with the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  program, and their clean seas initiative, which is tied to sustainable development goal 14. And that has shown already a galvanizing force of, I think it's over 30 countries making a commitment to achieve a clean sea, and now beat pollution.\par \par \uc2 There's all types of pollution, and so having these momentum-building movements at that international scale can really help to shine a light where it should be shined on great progress being moved forward, and then also providing a pathway forward to what do we have to hit by 2025? In our case, to make sure that we don't have more plastic by volume than fish in the ocean by 2025, we're going to see a lot more transformation of fish than you're currently seeing here with the males turning female.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Right.\par \par \uc2 Flowers: And I also wanted to mention, even with our work, we're also working with the United Nations. We've sent in a request to the \uc2 U.N\uc2 . special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who's going to be coming to Alabama on the 7th and 8th of December.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Okay, I have another question, but I want to take a question from \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and Ocogan asks: the last panel suggested business will take of sustainability concerns, especially as consumers demand it. Does this panel agree?\par \par \uc2 Ives: I\u8212\'20\'14yes and no. Can we say yes and no, both? I think it's important for consumers to make their voices known; to let corporations know what their interests are, what matters to them in communities, and what they expect from brand value propositions. So, if you have a favorite brand that you love, but you know that it's polluting the ocean, or it's polluting our communities, or it's not doing enough around climate, we should make the voice known, and it's really up to those thoughtful leaders within the corporations to determine whether or not they have the strength of leadership to respond.\par \par \uc2 Fears: So, does it depend more on the consumer to push this, or does it depend more on the companies to recognize it?\par \par \uc2 Ives: I think it depends on\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Flowers: I think it's yes and no as well.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Yes and no is kind of\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, let me just give an example. There are some companies that are perpetuators of the pollution. But then there are also those companies that are\u8212\'20\'14that realize they have a social responsibility. There's a company, for an example, I can't identify who they are right now, that's working with us, on finding technological solutions to the on-site waste water problem. I think that that's\u8212\'20\'14for them to even take that social responsibility step towards finding a solution is the key to how we get past where we are right now.\par \par \uc2 Fears: And in that instance, who approached who? Did they approach you? Or did you\u8212\'20\'14\par \par \uc2 Flowers: They approaches us.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Okay. Out of the blue?\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Yes.\par \par \uc2 Ives: I think what\u8212\'20\'14oh, I'm so sorry.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Ives: I think what you're going to see more and more of is thoughtful companies that are focused on their bottom line, taking these environmental and social issues more seriously. We have to have a more circular economy perspective in the work that we do environmentally as corporations, and those that are able to take that forward looking, long-term perspective on the health of the planet, are the ones that are going to be profitable. They're the ones that are going to continue to survive. So, the question we should be asking is which corporations are going to be here for the long haul?\par \par \uc2 Shane: Yeah, and where is the real leadership coming from? I think it has to be the corporations and the government working together, and frankly, it has to be very strong leadership from each sector, which is hard and there's only so many people willing to do that. And those are the mayors, or maybe the governor, the local leader, the local business, or a corporate\u8212\'20\'14global, that is going to stand up and say, "We think we can do this better with less impact, or more positive impact on our customer, let's say, but on the globe as well."\par \par \uc2 Governments and businesses aren't going to just solve it by themselves. You really have to be looking at where the leadership is coming from, and how quickly that can be shared out, and then ideally, the customers are going to demand that those better solutions pervade the market\u8212\'20\'14take over the market.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Okay, we have a question from Alan on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  who asks: for disadvantaged communities, is there too much focus or overpromising of advanced technologies when incremental improvements could be made to more conventional technologies, to make them more sustainable?\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, I guess I'll answer that question. I believe that\u8212\'20\'14I don't think that we've overpromised what's available to other people around the country, and even within the state itself. I think the problem has been the structures have been in place where the funding that would go into support those type of technological\u8212\'20\'14we're not even talking about advances, the extension\u8212\'20\'14we're talking about communities where people are paying waste water treatment fees, and it's still coming back into their homes.\par \par \uc2 So, at what point do they get from the outhouse to where they can flush their toilets and not have to worry about seeing the feces in their own homes? I think that we have the technology here to do it; the question is the access, and I think what we have to look at across the board as we're talking about clean energy, as we talk about even these basic things, we've got to make sure that\u8212\'20\'14we need to have a diversity program and an inclusion program in that movement, too, because it's not there. And therefore, we wouldn't continue to have these environmental justice issues that keep manifesting over and over again. And this is a basic issue that I think that we should have solved a long time ago, and the technology is there. The question is the will there? And is there the means to make sure that the money is spent equitably?\par \par \uc2 I'll give you an example. Recently, there was a grant that was just given to a town of connected businesses who are having on-site waste water problems. However, within five minutes of the town hall, where people had raw sewage on the ground, they're left to their own devices, and they're being criminalized because they can't afford the solution.\par \par \uc2 Shane: I think there is a risk that sort of the new, shiny technology overshadows the basic changes that in an earlier discussion about the need for efficiency maybe before renewables, or that the cheapest energy reductions you can get, or the energy you don't use. So, I think there can be an imbalance in paying more for a new, shiny technology when a basic solution of delivering community-based services that bring efficiency, that bring better water quality whether it's at Flynt, when you're giving someone a filter for their water as an important first step before you spend $200 million retrofitting a water system.\par \par \uc2 So, I think there is some risk that even though you want the new technologies to be advancing, and to be getting ever-more efficient, and ever cheaper, so that they can really expand in the market, there is a risk sometimes that you overlook the basic needs and cheaper solutions.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Okay, we've got four minutes left, and I wanted to take two audience questions. The first is for Brendan. How do cities hold each other accountable as the actions of one has an environmental impact on the other? Quickly.\par \par \uc2 Shane: Quick. Well, that's a tough question. When there literally are in close proximity, they can hold each other accountable directly. I think one of the problems with our issues is they're big and they're esoteric, and it's about climate, and it's about \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . So, the steps we take for them to hold each other accountable is through reporting and transparency, making a public commitment, ideally seeing that commitment to, let's say, be carbon neutral or 100% renewable. Get that into the laws of your local community so that you're accountable for it, and then be reporting. We're working on protocols that allow people in all parts of the world to report apples to apples, essentially.\par \par \uc2 Fears: But aren't states turning to the courts to solve some of these problems?\par \par \uc2 Shane: Yeah, well, a lot of people are turning to courts to solve their problems, and so there are options, as well, where one community is really being wronged by another to take those issues to court.\par \par \uc2 Fears: The next question is for Dune and Catherine. How do you connect local efforts in Alabama with those more globally focused to clean oceans? I think it's a little unfair to Dune [NOISE] Alabama, but go ahead.\par \par \uc2 Flowers: Well, Alabama does have an issue. We share the Gulf coast. So, we've had the issues with the oil spills, and a lot of families have lost their livelihood that are fishermen, because of the \uc2 BP\uc2  oil spill. We also have a lot of issues related to the climate created more intensified hurricanes. So, we share those issues, as well. I think that what we have to do in terms of connecting with the global efforts, I had the opportunity to go to COP21. I'm also on the board of Climate Reality, and what we are doing is bringing climate training through the Center for Earth Ethics, to communities\u8212\'20\'14environmental justice communities that otherwise would not have access to this information.\par \par \uc2 Fears: And Dune? The global connection?\par \par \uc2 Ives: Plastic pollution\u8212\'20\'14nobody on the planet is immune from plastic pollution or the impacts, so we, with our campaign Stop Sucking, we decided to take it to a city and see if we could take over an entire city, and get them to go single-use plastic straw-free. We did that in Seattle, and what's happened as a result of that is we have interest from all over the world to take that citywide takeover model, and apply it to their cities. 40 cities globally right now, is what the request is. And so, what we're seeing is there is so much, I think\u8212\'20\'14what's the right word I want to use?\par \par \uc2 I guess disgust, quite honestly, with the amount of single-use plastics we have in our \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 , that people are seeing the opportunity to take that success and bring it to their communities and make a difference.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Just as a point of reference, what's the estimate for how many straws are used per day in the U.S. and around the world?\par \par \uc2 Ives: 500 million in the United States alone. The estimate that I've seen that's not verified yet is 1 billion per day, annually. And we know that there are a few brands that have their fair share in the stake of how many straws are put out there. At the end of the day, it's really about our relationship to being a to-go culture and society. We love taking our coffees to go. We love taking our ice teas to go. And we're probably not going to change that, so what we need are real solutions around different kinds of materials we can put into the market.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Straws are very pervasive. You can go to a restaurant and order water, and they will bring it out with a straw in it.\par \par \uc2 Ives: You will get a straw. Or your cocktail that has the two-straw plastic garnish. It's amazing.\par \par \uc2 Fears: Right. I'd like to thank you very much for appearing on the panel today. That's all the time we have. Thank you again for joining us, and thank you to everyone for joining us here at The \uc2 Washington Post\uc2  and online.

" Although the current administration's policies weren\u8217\'20\'19t explicitly discussed, they loomed large in the backdrop.\par \par \uc2 More: Business, community groups boost health partnerships\par \par \uc2 More: COKER: Use \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  to build trust, not as marketing ploy\par \par \uc2 More: Businesses, governments boost workforce health\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe planet is screwed,\u8221\'20\'1D Neil Gaugh, founder of British corporate consulting firm Neil Gaugh & Associates, said of global warming at the opening session of Wednesday\u8217\'20\'19s program. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are aware this is a problem. A lot of people are looking to businesses to solve the problem. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Gaugh and other speakers cited a growing realization among corporations that helping others is good for business and should be part and parcel of a company\u8217\'20\'19s core mission, not relegated to a must-do list.\par \par \uc2 Social and economic goals \u8220\'20\'1Ccan be combined into one thing,\u8221\'20\'1D Gaugh\u160\'00\'A0told an audience of about 500 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. He also issued\u160\'00\'A0a warning to companies that don\u8217\'20\'19t embrace corporate citizenship authentically.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe days of hiding behind your brand are over,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, comparing such efforts to putting lipstick on a gorilla - an image that promptly appeared on a large screen.\par \par \uc2 Gaugh said he once worked at BP and was involved in the oil giant's efforts to burnish its\u160\'00\'A0image on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  with the \u8220\'20\'1CBeyond Petroleum\u8221\'20\'1D ad campaign. But it was undermined\u160\'00\'A0by company accidents in Texas in 2005, Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat they ended up with was very dirty water,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 As if to punctuate Gaugh\u8217\'20\'19s message, a parade of company executives took the stage to describe how their \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0programs\u160\'00\'A0arose from personal experiences\u160\'00\'A0that sparked heartfelt commitments.\par \par \uc2 Chieh Huang, CEO of Boxed, an online retailer of bulk items, says he was inspired\u160\'00\'A0at an employee appreciation event when a box loaderwho had been laid off from another job in 2008 told him he had never before been honored in a corporate \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Huang said he realized, \u8220\'20\'1CWe were shepherding folks who had their entire livelihood in our hands. \u8221\'20\'1D He vowed, \u8220\'20\'1CWe will never let you down. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The New York City-based company helps pay the college tuition of workers\u8217\'20\'19 kids. And after an\u160\'00\'A0employee said he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t afford a wedding, Huang decided to offer staffers generous wedding stipends and unlimited vacations. Boxed also gives consumers rebates for what Huang\u160\'00\'A0considers unfair taxes on feminine hygiene products-often referred to as the "Pink Tax. "\par \par \uc2 Stephan Jacob, co-founder Cotopaxi, decided to weave citizenship into the company\u8217\'20\'19s mission because his earlier efforts at a nonprofit were chronically underfunded. Besides donating 2% of Cotopaxi\u8217\'20\'19s revenue to \u8220\'20\'1Chealth, education and livelihood\u8221\'20\'1D causes, the company, based in Salt Lake City, uses llama wool to make some clothing\u160\'00\'A0to help Bolivian llama farmers. It asks company software engineers to train refugees from Sudan and other countries to be software programmers. And to cut landfill waste, it uses excess materials from other backpack makers to produce a line of patchwork backpacks that is among its most popular. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can do good and do well economically at the same time,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Other corporate efforts:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Life is Good, which makes T-shirts with that and other upbeat slogans, channels 10% of its profits to its children\u8217\'20\'19s foundation. And it connects people inspired by its messages on social media.

So it\u8217\'20\'19s donating $20 million to revitalize the area while striving to keep many residents there. It also plans to build\u160\'00\'A0a restaurant in the neighborhood to lure other businesses even though it\u8217\'20\'19s not currently financially viable.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 \uc2 Entergy\uc2  is reducing its carbon emissions to 2000 levels, said Patty Riddlebarger, director of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

" Although the current administration's policies weren\u8217\'20\'19t explicitly discussed, they loomed large in the backdrop.\par \par \uc2 More: Business, community groups boost health partnerships\par \par \uc2 More: COKER: Use \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  to build trust, not as marketing ploy\par \par \uc2 More: Businesses, governments boost workforce health\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe planet is screwed,\u8221\'20\'1D Neil Gaugh, founder of British corporate consulting firm Neil Gaugh & Associates, said of global warming at the opening session of Wednesday\u8217\'20\'19s program. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are aware this is a problem. A lot of people are looking to businesses to solve the problem. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Gaugh and other speakers cited a growing realization among corporations that helping others is good for business and should be part and parcel of a company\u8217\'20\'19s core mission, not relegated to a must-do list.\par \par \uc2 Social and economic goals \u8220\'20\'1Ccan be combined into one thing,\u8221\'20\'1D Gaugh\u160\'00\'A0told an audience of about 500 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. He also issued\u160\'00\'A0a warning to companies that don\u8217\'20\'19t embrace corporate citizenship authentically.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe days of hiding behind your brand are over,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, comparing such efforts to putting lipstick on a gorilla - an image that promptly appeared on a large screen.\par \par \uc2 Gaugh said he once worked at BP and was involved in the oil giant's efforts to burnish its\u160\'00\'A0image on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  with the \u8220\'20\'1CBeyond Petroleum\u8221\'20\'1D ad campaign. But it was undermined\u160\'00\'A0by company accidents in Texas in 2005, Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat they ended up with was very dirty water,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 As if to punctuate Gaugh\u8217\'20\'19s message, a parade of company executives took the stage to describe how their \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0programs\u160\'00\'A0arose from personal experiences\u160\'00\'A0that sparked heartfelt commitments.\par \par \uc2 Chieh Huang, CEO of Boxed, an online retailer of bulk items, says he was inspired\u160\'00\'A0at an employee appreciation event when a box loaderwho had been laid off from another job in 2008 told him he had never before been honored in a corporate \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Huang said he realized, \u8220\'20\'1CWe were shepherding folks who had their entire livelihood in our hands. \u8221\'20\'1D He vowed, \u8220\'20\'1CWe will never let you down. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The New York City-based company helps pay the college tuition of workers\u8217\'20\'19 kids. And after an\u160\'00\'A0employee said he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t afford a wedding, Huang decided to offer staffers generous wedding stipends and unlimited vacations. Boxed also gives consumers rebates for what Huang\u160\'00\'A0considers unfair taxes on feminine hygiene products-often referred to as the "Pink Tax. "\par \par \uc2 Stephan Jacob, co-founder Cotopaxi, decided to weave citizenship into the company\u8217\'20\'19s mission because his earlier efforts at a nonprofit were chronically underfunded. Besides donating 2% of Cotopaxi\u8217\'20\'19s revenue to \u8220\'20\'1Chealth, education and livelihood\u8221\'20\'1D causes, the company, based in Salt Lake City, uses llama wool to make some clothing\u160\'00\'A0to help Bolivian llama farmers. It asks company software engineers to train refugees from Sudan and other countries to be software programmers. And to cut landfill waste, it uses excess materials from other backpack makers to produce a line of patchwork backpacks that is among its most popular. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can do good and do well economically at the same time,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Other corporate efforts:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Life is Good, which makes T-shirts with that and other upbeat slogans, channels 10% of its profits to its children\u8217\'20\'19s foundation. And it connects people inspired by its messages on social media. If a job applicant doesn\u8217\'20\'19t commit to its philosophy of spreading optimism, \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t want you,\u8221\'20\'1D said company president Lisa Tanzer.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 In their\u160\'00\'A0home base in Atlanta, \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  executives\u160\'00\'A0grew weary of seeing rampant poverty and blight in the Northside Drive neighborhood, which\u160\'00\'A0sits in the shadows of\u160\'00\'A0one of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s top corporate hubs. \u8220\'20\'1CWe said, \u8216\'20\'18We can do better than this,\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D said Rodney Bullard, the company\u8217\'20\'19s vice president of community affairs. So it\u8217\'20\'19s donating $20 million to revitalize the area while striving to keep many residents there. It also plans to build\u160\'00\'A0a restaurant in the neighborhood to lure other businesses even though it\u8217\'20\'19s not currently financially viable.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 \uc2 Entergy\uc2  is reducing its carbon emissions to 2000 levels, said Patty Riddlebarger, director of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

" Although the current administration's policies weren\u8217\'20\'19t explicitly discussed, they loomed large in the backdrop.\par \par \uc2 More: Business, community groups boost health partnerships\par \par \uc2 More: COKER: Use \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  to build trust, not as marketing ploy\par \par \uc2 More: Businesses, governments boost workforce health\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe planet is screwed,\u8221\'20\'1D Neil Gaugh, founder of British corporate consulting firm Neil Gaugh & Associates, said of global warming at the opening session of Wednesday\u8217\'20\'19s program. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are aware this is a problem. A lot of people are looking to businesses to solve the problem. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Gaugh and other speakers cited a growing realization among corporations that helping others is good for business and should be part and parcel of a company\u8217\'20\'19s core mission, not relegated to a must-do list.\par \par \uc2 Social and economic goals \u8220\'20\'1Ccan be combined into one thing,\u8221\'20\'1D Gaugh\u160\'00\'A0told an audience of about 500 at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center. He also issued\u160\'00\'A0a warning to companies that don\u8217\'20\'19t embrace corporate citizenship authentically.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe days of hiding behind your brand are over,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, comparing such efforts to putting lipstick on a gorilla - an image that promptly appeared on a large screen.\par \par \uc2 Gaugh said he once worked at BP and was involved in the oil giant's efforts to burnish its\u160\'00\'A0image on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  with the \u8220\'20\'1CBeyond Petroleum\u8221\'20\'1D ad campaign. But it was undermined\u160\'00\'A0by company accidents in Texas in 2005, Alaska in 2006 and the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\par \par \uc2 Today, BP\u160\'00\'A0is working to balance its commitment to shareholders and what it sees as its responsibility to help ensure a future where power is generated in a way that meaningfully reduces the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from conventional fossil fuel energy production. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 "For all companies, especially publicly traded we\u8217\'20\'19ve got this quarterly demand for results and performance and that certainly drives the day-to-day thinking often, but we also recognize there is this real long term we have the responsibility to contribute towards, " said Ray Dempsey Jr. chief diversity officer at BP America and president of the BP Foundation in a separate session. "So in this lower carbon-energy future, our commitment is to provide the world\u8217\'20\'19s energy needs today - in whatever forms those are -\u160\'00\'A0\u160\'00\'A0and prepare for this lower carbon energy future, and we must do both. It\u8217\'20\'19s not a tradeoff\u160\'00\'A0. . . It\u8217\'20\'19s not a one or the other. We must do both and we must do it in a way that it meets the obligations to society to keep the lights and the power and the vehicles moving today and make sure we have the opportunity to still do that for generations to come. "\par \par \uc2 During the conference, a parade of company executives took the stage to describe how their \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0programs\u160\'00\'A0arose from personal experiences\u160\'00\'A0that sparked heartfelt commitments.\par \par \uc2 Chieh Huang, CEO of Boxed, an online retailer of bulk items, says he was inspired\u160\'00\'A0at an employee appreciation event when a box loaderwho had been laid off from another job in 2008 told him he had never before been honored in a corporate \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . Huang said he realized, \u8220\'20\'1CWe were shepherding folks who had their entire livelihood in our hands. \u8221\'20\'1D He vowed, \u8220\'20\'1CWe will never let you down. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The New York City-based company helps pay the college tuition of workers\u8217\'20\'19 kids. And after an\u160\'00\'A0employee said he couldn\u8217\'20\'19t afford a wedding, Huang decided to offer staffers generous wedding stipends and unlimited vacations. Boxed also gives consumers rebates for what Huang\u160\'00\'A0considers unfair taxes on feminine hygiene products-often referred to as the "Pink Tax. "\par \par \uc2 Stephan Jacob, co-founder Cotopaxi, decided to weave citizenship into the company\u8217\'20\'19s mission because his earlier efforts at a nonprofit were chronically underfunded. Besides donating 2% of Cotopaxi\u8217\'20\'19s revenue to \u8220\'20\'1Chealth, education and livelihood\u8221\'20\'1D causes, the company, based in Salt Lake City, uses llama wool to make some clothing\u160\'00\'A0to help Bolivian llama farmers. It asks company software engineers to train refugees from Sudan and other countries to be software programmers. And to cut landfill waste, it uses excess materials from other backpack makers to produce a line of patchwork backpacks that is among its most popular. \u8220\'20\'1CYou can do good and do well economically at the same time,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Other corporate efforts:\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 Life is Good, which makes T-shirts with that and other upbeat slogans, channels 10% of its profits to its children\u8217\'20\'19s foundation. And it connects people inspired by its messages on social media. If a job applicant doesn\u8217\'20\'19t commit to its philosophy of spreading optimism, \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t want you,\u8221\'20\'1D said company president Lisa Tanzer.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 In their\u160\'00\'A0home base in Atlanta, \uc2 Chick-fil-A\uc2  executives\u160\'00\'A0grew weary of seeing rampant poverty and blight in the Northside Drive neighborhood, which\u160\'00\'A0sits in the shadows of\u160\'00\'A0one of the nation\u8217\'20\'19s top corporate hubs. \u8220\'20\'1CWe said, \u8216\'20\'18We can do better than this,\u8217\'20\'19\u8221\'20\'1D said Rodney Bullard, the company\u8217\'20\'19s vice president of community affairs. So it\u8217\'20\'19s donating $20 million to revitalize the area while striving to keep many residents there. It also plans to build\u160\'00\'A0a restaurant in the neighborhood to lure other businesses even though it\u8217\'20\'19s not currently financially viable.\par \par \uc2 \u8226\'20\'22 \uc2 Entergy\uc2  is reducing its carbon emissions to 2000 levels, said Patty Riddlebarger, director of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 .

Here's the sign-up.\par \par \uc2 The tech reckoning is gaining momentum.\par \par \uc2 American technology giants are facing an increasing backlash. \uc2 Google\uc2 -parent Alphabet, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers over the manipulation of social media during the 2016 election by Russian operatives. Critics of \uc2 Amazon\uc2  say it is killing jobs. Across the pond, European regulators have gone after American tech firms over privacy and what officials deem anticompetitive behavior.\par \par \uc2 Now \uc2 Jana Partners\uc2  and pension giant \uc2 Calstrs\uc2  are pushing Apple to do more to protect its youngest users from the effects of digital technology.\par \par \uc2 Writes Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Gadfly:\par \par \uc2 ''One letter from \uc2 Calstrs\uc2  and Jana may amount to nothing. It's becoming increasingly clear, however, that scrutiny over technology companies and their products isn't going away.\par \par \uc2 ''There will be much discussion about whether technology companies, or people and parents, bear responsibility for limiting the harmful effects of technology. Even smartphone overuse isn't Apple's problem alone. Its gadgets are gateways to people hooked on \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , Snapchat and much more. We are all the problem, and the technology companies are all the problem.''\par \par \uc2 Still, compared to \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Google\uc2  or Snap, Apple is an unusual choice for the investors to target, writes Jennifer Saba of Breakingviews. The company makes hardware and uses privacy as a selling point. For those reasons, Apple was expected to avoid the worst of the blowback. But its targeting shows the extent to which the backlash against tech is gaining momentum: Writes Ms. Saba:\par \par \uc2 ''Silicon Valley used to enjoy an exalted status, but questions about the role of social media in the 2016 presidential election and the way digital technologies may threaten jobs and promote monopolies are breeding skepticism. The new focus on Apple shows how much technology has lost its halo.''\par \par \uc2 Rick Perry's Plan to Rescue Struggling Coal and Nuclear Plants Is Rejected\par \par \uc2 Federal regulators have rejected a proposal by Energy Secretary Rick Perry to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants, in a major blow to the Trump administration's efforts to revive America's declining coal industry, the \uc2 NYT\uc2  reports.\par \par \uc2 In September, Mr. Perry warned that the loss of these plants could threaten the ''reliability and resiliency of our nation's grid'' and asked the \uc2 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\uc2 , which oversees regional electricity markets, to guarantee financial returns for power plants that can stockpile at least 90 days' worth of fuel on-site -- which, in effect, meant propping up uncompetitive coal and nuclear units. (Natural gas plants are typically fed by pipeline and would not qualify.)\par \par \uc2 While a few utilities with significant coal and nuclear capacity supported the idea, Mr. Perry's proposal generated a fierce backlash from a broad coalition of energy companies, free-market groups and former regulators.\par \par \uc2 Ripple takes a big hit.\par \par \uc2 Only last week, Ripple appeared to lay claim to the biggest alternative to Bitcoin. That isn't the case anymore.\par \par \uc2 The price of Ripple's XRP virtual currency has plunged about 27 percent over the past 24 hours, reaching $2.47 this morning, according to CoinMarketCap. Ripple's total market capitalization has fallen back below that of \uc2 Ethereum\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To be fair, other virtual currencies -- including Bitcoin -- are falling as well.\par \par \uc2 It was only last week: Investors breathlessly touted Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen, who owns a significant amount of XRP, as richer than \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The breathlessness hasn't abated: Shares in \uc2 Seagate\uc2  were briefly up more than 10 percent on Monday amid excited speculation that the hard drive company owned a huge stake in XRP as part of its investment in Ripple almost three years ago. (It's not clear that's actually the case.)\par \par \uc2 -- Michael J. de la Merced\par \par \uc2 GoPro\uc2 's woes continue to grow.\par \par \uc2 Its announcement of preliminary fourth-quarter results today compounds the troubles for what has been one of the most disappointing market debutantes in recent years.\par \par \uc2 The company issued a revenue forecast that was lighter than analysts were expecting. And the action-camera maker announced its latest efforts to turn around its business:\par \par \uc2 Laying off at least 254 employees, bringing its headcount to under 1,000 worldwide\par \par \uc2 Its founder and C.E.O., \uc2 Nick Woodman\uc2 , reducing his cash compensation this year to $1.\par \par \uc2 Getting out of the drone market amid ''a hostile regulatory \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 '' in Europe and the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Over all, \uc2 GoPro\uc2 's shares have fallen 79 percent since the company's I.P.O. three-and-a-half years ago.\par \par \uc2 -- Michael J. de la Merced\par \par \uc2 How much of its tax windfall will Apple spend on buybacks?\par \par \uc2 Steven Milunovich\uc2 , an analyst at UBS, expects the iPhone maker to use the overseas cash it repatriates to buy back $122 billion in stock through 2019.\par \par \uc2 The company holds about $252 billion cash offshore. Mr. Milunovich via CNBC writes:\par \par \uc2 ''Repatriation of ~$250bn of offshore cash should increase the rate of Apple's share buybacks since the company believes the stock remains attractive in that its services business is undervalued.''\par \par \uc2 Apple has bought back more than $165 billion of stock over the past five years.\par \par \uc2 Is 2018 the year that \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is sold?\par \par \uc2 The analyst \uc2 Rich Greenfield\uc2  of BTIG thinks so. Leading his list of predictions for the year is speculation that the social network would finally become the target of deal-making. (Remember that \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  had held talks to buy the company in the fall of 2016.)\par \par \uc2 From Mr. Greenfield's note:\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  offers a unique acquisition opportunity for any company looking to own breaking news, politics and sports, infused with video on mobile devices with tens of millions of daily active users across the world. Add to that a vast treasure trove of data on its users and a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  acquisition becomes compelling for many companies across the TMT universe.\par \par \uc2 Who would buy \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ? Maybe \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  comes back. Or maybe \uc2 Google\uc2  does. Or \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Other predictions\par \par \uc2 AT&T\uc2  will defeat the Justice Department in the court battle over \uc2 Time Warner\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 CBS\uc2  and \uc2 Viacom\uc2  finally combine.\par \par \uc2 Spotify will go public this year, but may sell itself down the road.\par \par \uc2 -- Michael J. de la Merced\par \par \uc2 How long can \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's rally last?\par \par \uc2 The chip-maker's stock is up 2.5 percent Monday. The driver? News that \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  will partner with Uber and \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2  on autonomous driving projects.\par \par \uc2 Reuters reports:\par \par \uc2 ''Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas that Uber's self-driving car fleet was using their technology to help its autonomous cars perceive the world and make split-second decisions.''\par \par \uc2 ''With \uc2 Volkswagen\uc2 , \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  said it was infusing its artificial intelligence technology into the German automakers' future lineup, using their new Drive IX platform. The technology will enable so-called ''intelligent co-pilot'' capabilities based on processing sensor data inside and outside the car.''\par \par \uc2 Some context: Shares of \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  more than doubled over the past 12 months after a roughly 200 percent gain in 2016. The rally in \uc2 Nvidia\uc2 's shares has come as demand for chips to power data centers, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and gaming has surged.\par \par \uc2 Nvidia\uc2  said that ''320 companies involved in self-driving cars - whether software developers, automakers and their suppliers, sensor and mapping companies - are using Nvidia Drive, formerly branded as the Drive PX2,'' Reuters reports.\par \par \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 's woes continue.\par \par \uc2 The German bank is down seven percent the past two days after it said it would post a small loss for 2017, its third consecutive annual. Weak trading and a $1.8 billion hit from the United State's tax overhaul are the main culprits.\par \par \uc2 Of those, \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 's trading woes should be more concerning to shareholders, writes Christopher Thompson of Breakingviews.\par \par \uc2 The bank said sales and trading revenue was expected to decline 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year ago. While \uc2 Deutsche Bank\uc2 's trading performance has not be appreciably worse than its European rivals, the decline in its shares ''is that it is more dependent on this revenue than other big investment banks.''\par \par \uc2 ''Equities and fixed income sales and trading brought in more than 31 percent of Deutsche's total revenue in the third quarter of 2017, compared with around 28 percent at \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2  and 19 percent at \uc2 Barclays\uc2 . The German group also lacks a consistent source of stable earnings similar to \uc2 Credit Suisse\uc2 's wealth management franchise or \uc2 Barclays\uc2 's UK retail bank.''\par \par \uc2 That means that ''without a pickup in volatility or client activity, trading revenues -- and shareholders -- remain stuck in a rut,'' Mr. Thompson writes.\par \par \uc2 If your business flight to New York was disrupted this weekend, here's why.\par \par \uc2 Jason Rabinowitz of The Points Guy explained how John F. Kennedy International Airport in particular functions -- and why its operations were severely disrupted even after the ''bomb cyclone'' of last week.\par \par \uc2 Among the interesting pieces of trivia to emerge from the piece:\par \par \uc2 Essentially, each terminal at JFK is its own little fiefdom with separate operations, management and employees. If an airline calls Terminal 7 home, that's the only terminal it's allowed to use. Even if Terminal 4 has a dozen empty gates, an airline slated for Terminal 7 may have to wait hours for a gate to open at Terminal 7.\par \par \uc2 Here's Mr. Rabinowitz's concluding thought:\par \par \uc2 Savvy travelers all know to avoid NYC area airports whenever possible, and this winter storm drove that point home once again.\par \par \uc2 -- Michael J. de la Merced\par \par \uc2 Intel\uc2 's C.E.O. is in the hot seat, just in time for CES.\par \par \uc2 Questions \uc2 Brian Krzanich\uc2  is likely to face about as he prepares for a keynote speech at the biggest convention in consumer electronics:\par \par \uc2 How well will planned fixes work against Meltdown and Spectre, the two computer chip security flaws that affect most of the world's processors?\par \par \uc2 Can \uc2 Intel\uc2  design new chips without either of the problems?\par \par \uc2 Were the $39 million worth of stock sales he made in November, after the flaws were discovered but before they were disclosed, really just part of a prearranged trading plan?\par \par \uc2 What he would prefer to talk about: Augmented reality and self-driving cars.\par \par \uc2 Today's talking point, from Nathaniel Fick, the C.E.O. of the cybersecurity company Endgame, in an \uc2 NYT\uc2  Op-Ed:\par \par \uc2 From a corporate governance and accountability perspective, cybersecurity today is being treated like accounting was before the fallout from the \uc2 Enron\uc2  scandal inspired the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's increased standards for corporate disclosures.\par \par \uc2 The tech flyaround, CES edition\par \par \uc2 The convention's organizers said they were seeking more women speakers.

(Variety)\par \par \uc2 #MeToo and Oprah take center stage at the Golden Globes.\par \par \uc2 Among the highlights from last night's awards, where the uniform was black to acknowledge systemic harassment and sexism in Hollywood:\par \par \uc2 Oprah Winfrey\uc2 , who received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement, used her acceptance speech as a call to arms, saying, ''A new day is on the horizon.'' Speculation has arisen about whether she might run for president.\par \par \uc2 The actresses Debra Messing and Eva Longoria used red-carpet interviews to chastise the E! network on gender pay inequity.\par \par \uc2 Several actresses arrived with activists as their guests.\par \par \uc2 The actress Natalie Portman, introducing the best director award, said, ''Here are the all-male nominees.''\par \par \uc2 The host Seth Meyers quipped, ''It's been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood.''\par \par \uc2 The misconduct flyaround\par \par \uc2 An array of start-ups is offering resources for women and companies to halt harassment at work.

(\uc2 NYT\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 Carrie Gracie, a senior editor for BBC News, stepped down from as China editor in a protest against pay inequality, calling the broadcaster's salary system ''secretive and illegal.'' (\uc2 NYT\uc2 )\par \par \uc2 Will \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2  have to sell more stakes?\par \par \uc2 Revelations about more ties between the \uc2 Kushner Companies\uc2  and Israeli businesses like the insurer Menora Mivtachim have raised questions about \uc2 Jared Kushner\uc2 's wealth and the complicated relationships that his family's company has around the world. (Particularly given Mr. Kushner's role as a top envoy for Middle Eastern peace, as well as a senior adviser in his father-in-law's White House.)\par \par \uc2 Caveat: The \uc2 NYT\uc2  says that recent deals don't appear to violate federal ethics laws, and Mr. Kushner appears not to have been personally involved.

"What will you do with increased after-tax cash flow, and how will you use it to create long-term value?" Fink wrote. "This is a particularly critical moment for companies to explain their long-term plans to investors."\par \par \uc2 The missive comes as business leaders are navigating a potentially tricky path in the wake of enactment of the GOP tax package. Republicans are eager to see them hand out bonuses, wage gains and other new benefits to workers as evidence that the deep cut to the corporate tax rate is\u160\'00\'A0proving its value to average Americans.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Democrats, meanwhile, are deriding those benefits as crumbs, no more than a rolling public relations campaign by corporate giants to thank the GOP for the windfall (a new poll shows it may be working, with support for the tax overhaul\u160\'00\'A0nine points,\u160\'00\'A0to 46 percent, over just a month ago). Executives and shareholders, Democrats say, will still claim the lion's share.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Among the big banks themselves, the fate of their surprisingly large tax breaks remains an open question. \uc2 Citigroup\uc2 , in announcing its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, reported taking a one-time, $22 billion hit from the reconfigured tax code. But the bank expects to see a significant lift. "Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns," CEO \uc2 Michael Corbat\uc2 \u160\'00\'A0said in a statement, "but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward."\par \par \uc2 As the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 's Jim Tankersley notes, more than 70 financial institutions\u160\'00\'A0have announced higher wages and bonuses for workers, accounting for about half of all companies that have promised to share the wealth from the cuts with employees. But, he writes, those goodies "reflect a small slice of the windfall that banks large and small are in line to receive."\par \par \uc2 Take \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  and \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2 , which announced their earnings Friday and revealed they stand to collect a combined $7 billion in tax relief. Bloomberg News's Hugh Son and Laura J. Keller summarize the competing demands on that haul: "Borrowers including small businesses and big corporations will want better pricing. Employees from tellers to rainmakers will press for raises and bigger bonuses. And then there's the political pressure banks face to invest more in communities, particularly those with the least access to credit."\par \par \uc2 JPMorgan's chief financial officer, \uc2 Marianne Lake\uc2 , pledged to unveil a plan in the next few weeks to support local investment \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0"really constructive, thoughtful things for all of our constituents" \u8212\'20\'14 but added that most of the windfall will end up elsewhere, with much of it going to the bank's bottom line this year and later.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 It's hardly clear that Fink, for all the pull that \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 's size would seem to confer, is going to meaningfully reshape conversations in boardrooms on Wall Street and beyond. For one, \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  is still working through what to do with its own tax windfall. On its earnings call last week, the firm's chief financial officer projected it will make $1.2 billion in stock buybacks this year, plus more divided payments, in addition to evaluating "our ability to more aggressively seed and co-invest in new products."\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 So, could Fink's letter be its own public relations maneuver? Bloomberg Gadfly's Stephen Gandel suggests as much, noting the investment chief has used the annual message to call for greater \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  before, with little apparent follow-up. "Fink's bark is always going to be louder than his bite," he writes. "\uc2 BlackRock\uc2  does nearly all of its stock market investing through index funds. So, no matter how much it disapproves of a company's stance on the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  or whatever, it can't actually sell."\par \par \uc2 I asked \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  on Tuesday how it intends to follow up on Fink's letter and didn't hear back. Fink and \uc2 Barbara Novick\uc2 , a \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  cofounder he's named to oversee the firm's investment stewardship efforts, will both be in Davos next week, and I will, too, so I'll do my best to get an answer then.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 MARKET MOVERS MONEY ON THE HILL \u8212\'20\'14 Shutdown watch. The Post's\u160\'00\'A0Erica Werner and Mike DeBonis: "House Republican leaders presented their rank and file with a one-month spending bill Tuesday aimed at keeping the government open ahead of a Friday night deadline, as hopes for a deal on young undocumented immigrants faded. The bill would extend existing spending levels through Feb. 16 and include an extension of a popular children's health insurance program \u8212\'20\'14 aimed at winning Democratic votes \u8212\'20\'14 and a new sweetener for conservatives and Democrats alike in delaying several taxes included in the Affordable Care Act. Few lawmakers were enthusiastic about the legislation, but several described it as a necessary evil to avoid the first government shutdown since 2013... [Leaders]\u160\'00\'A0planned to test support Wednesday and bring the bill to a vote Thursday, according to multiple members. It was not immediately clear whether they would be successful."\par \par \uc2 House GOP may target Obamacare. \uc2 Politico\uc2 's Rachael Bade and Jennifer Haberkorn: "House GOP leaders may load up a temporary government funding bill with Obamacare tax delays in a bid to win over reluctant Republicans and avoid a shutdown at week's end. Speaker \uc2 Paul Ryan\uc2  and his team will huddle with rank-and-file GOP lawmakers in what's expected to be a contentious conference meeting Tuesday night. Senior Republican sources say GOP leaders will float several options to try to secure Republicans votes on what will be the fourth spending stopgap since September \u8212\'20\'14 an embarrassing practice that Republicans say puts the military at risk."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Chamber to push gas tax. The Post's John Wagner: "With President Trump and Congress turning their attention to infrastructure in the coming weeks, the \uc2 U.S. Chamber of Commerce\uc2  is preparing for an uphill battle: a push to raise the federal gas tax by 25 cents per gallon to help pay for the initiative.\par \par \uc2 The proposal, which will be formally introduced later this week, is part of a series of principles the nation's largest business lobby will offer in a bid to help shape the debate about upgrading U.S. roads, bridges, airports and other critical infrastructure. Chamber President \uc2 Thomas J. Donohue\uc2  said his organization wants 'to put our oar in the water'\u160\'00\'A0and acknowledged that it would be 'a tough vote'\u160\'00\'A0to raise the gas tax for the first time since 1993. But he said that support has been building in the business community and elsewhere."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 No Sen. T-Paw. \uc2 Politico\uc2 's Kevin Robillard: "Former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty said Tuesday he won't run in a special election for the Senate later this year. Pawlenty, now the CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, a powerful bank lobbying group, ruled out a run during an appearance on \uc2 Fox Business Network\uc2 . 'I'm interested in continuing to serve,'\u160\'00\'A0Pawlenty said. 'There's a variety of ways to do that, [but] running for \uc2 U.S. Senate\uc2  this year won't be one of them.'...\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Minnesota, traditionally a blue state, has trended Republican in recent years, and Democratic presidential nominee \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2  won it by just two percentage points in 2016. Democrats, however, thought they would be able to use Pawlenty's post-gubernatorial career as a conservative presidential candidate and bank lobbyist as a way to convince Minnesotans their former governor was out of step with the state."\par \par \uc2 POCKET CHANGE CRYPTO CHAOS:\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Cryptocurrencies slump. Bloomberg's Eric Lam: "Bitcoin continues to wobble, trading near $11,000 a day after losing a quarter of its value as traders sought a floor for pricing amid growing concern regulators around the world will move ahead with new rules to restrict the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. The largest digital currency rose 1 percent to $10,831 at 12:20 p.m. in Hong Kong after slumping as much as 26 percent Tuesday, according to Bloomberg composite pricing. Rival cryptocurrencies Ripple and \uc2 Ethereum\uc2  swung between gains and losses...\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Speculators across the globe are struggling to determine when or how market watchdogs may rein in an industry that's decentralized and derives much of its value from anonymous ownership. Many assertions that digital coins represent a bubble have triggered double-digit selloffs over the past year, only to be followed by rebounds. In South Korea, shutting down cryptocurrency exchanges is still an option amid ongoing discussions, Finance Minister \uc2 Kim Dong-yeon\uc2  said in an interview with \uc2 TBS\uc2  radio Jan. 16. Kim said there's irrational speculation and that rational regulation was needed."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Beyond the bubble. NYT's Steven Johnson: "You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?\u160\'00\'A0But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation... The Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system."\par \par \uc2 TRUMP TRACKER \u8212\'20\'14\u160\'00\'A0Barra to Trump: Don't blow up \uc2 NAFTA\uc2 . NYT's Neal E. Boudette: "General Motors' chief executive urged the Trump administration on Tuesday not to scrap the \uc2 North American Free Trade Agreement\uc2 , and said any changes in the pact should account for the effect on American automakers and workers. 'There could be unintended consequences, changes made, that would directly impact jobs in the United States,'\u160\'00\'A0the G.M. chief, \uc2 Mary T. Barra\uc2 , said at an investor conference on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.

Bannon\uc2  to appear before a grand jury, a move that indicates his broad investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 campaign is far from wrapping up. The subpoena was issued last week, according to a person familiar with the situation, who said that Bannon expects to be able to persuade the special counsel's office to accept a voluntary interview of Bannon by prosecutors in place of a grand jury appearance. The news of Mueller's action, which was first reported by the \uc2 New York Times\uc2 , came on the same day that the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Bannon for refusing to answer a range of questions from investigators during a combative closed-door interview, frustrating members of both parties who are probing the Trump campaign's alleged Russia ties."\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Manafort trial in Sept.\u160\'00\'A0The Post's\u160\'00\'A0Spencer S.

Mueller III\uc2 . Prosecutors told the court Friday that they intended to ask for a May 14 trial date for Manafort, 68, and his former business partner, \uc2 Rick Gates\uc2 , 45, whose Oct. 30 indictments on fraud, conspiracy and money laundering counts were the first disclosed in Mueller's probe of Russian influence in U.S. political affairs."\par \par \uc2 THE REGULATORS \u8212\'20\'14 CFPB\u160\'00\'A0reviews\u160\'00\'A0payday lending rule. WSJ's\u160\'00\'A0Yuka Hayashi: "The Trump administration's acting head of the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  plans to reconsider federal restrictions on high-interest payday loans, a step that could lead to the easing of a rule opposed by the industry and some Republicans. The rule, completed last year when the bureau was still under Obama-era leadership, clamped down on small, short-term consumer loans that can have interest rates as high as 400%. Among other things, it would require lenders to limit loan rollovers and assess whether borrowers can repay the short-term loans.\par \par \uc2 The CFPB completed the rule in November, days before White House budget chief \uc2 Mick Mulvaney\uc2 , a critic of the agency appointed by President \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  as CFPB acting director, succeeded former director \uc2 Richard Cordray\uc2 . As a South Carolina congressman, he opposed the CFPB's regulatory efforts on several fronts, including payday lending.

As NCUA chairman, McWatters has publicly stated support for credit unions getting preferential regulatory treatment over banks, due to what he suggests is a safer business model."\par \par \uc2 CHART TOPPER From The Visual Capitalist: "The Most Valuable Companies of All Time: "\par \par \uc2 DAYBOOK Today\par \par \uc2 * The \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  holds a\u160\'00\'A0markup\u160\'00\'A0of various bills.\par \par \uc2 * The Senate Finance Committee holds a\u160\'00\'A0hearing\u160\'00\'A0on United States Trade Representative nominees.\par \par \uc2 * The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs committee\u160\'00\'A0holds an executive session\u160\'00\'A0to vote on \uc2 Jerome Powell\uc2  to be chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System and Randal Quarles to be reappointed as a member of the board of governors of the \uc2 Federal Reserve System\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Coming Up\par \par \uc2 * The \uc2 American Enterprise Institute\uc2  holds an\u160\'00\'A0event\u160\'00\'A0on "New thinking about poverty and economic mobility" on\u160\'00\'A0Thursday\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 The Cato Institute\uc2  Policy Perspectives 2018, including a\u160\'00\'A0discussion\u160\'00\'A0on "A Fiscal Rule to Tame Federal Debt?", takes place on\u160\'00\'A0Thursday.\par \par \uc2 * The SEC-NYU Dialogue on Securities Markets \u8211\'20\'13 Shareholder Engagement\u160\'00\'A0will be held\u160\'00\'A0in New York on\u160\'00\'A0Friday.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 THE FUNNIES From the New Yorker:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 BULL SESSION Here's what you need to know about the latest DACA decision:\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 President Trump says "black unemployment is the best it's ever been in recorded history:"\par \par \uc2 Sen.

He's right. Over the 10 years ending 2017, annual returns on the average large-cap CSR fund were 7.8%, trailing the 8.5% return of the S&P 500 by 0.7%. But actively managed large-cap funds that don't consider CSR issues performed even worse, earning 7.7% per year and trailing the index by 0.8%. There may be valid objections to CSR funds, but over the past decade they've performed slightly better than their non-CSR peers. The S&P 500 remains a tough standard for all active managers to outpace.\par \par \uc2 John C.

That darker flip side involves a "climate risk disclosure" industry. Players in this "CRD" movement include state attorneys general, comptrollers and treasurers, and lawmakers combining with public pension funds, interest groups and, of course, contingency-fee lawyers. Even academics admit to expecting a taste of the expected settlement fund.\par \par \uc2 The campaign seeks to impede access to capital\u8212\'20\'14one player called it "divestment through value destruction." The effective goal is to coerce "confessions" in energy-related interests' public filings that catastrophic man-made global warming is a real problem of which they constitute a significant part, that their reserves are in fact worth little to nothing and their previous filings and other statements constitute actionable misdeeds, possibly fraud.\par \par \uc2 The "social investing" industry represents more than suspect fiscal responsibility. It also embodies the darker attributes of the climate and environmental industries.\par \par \uc2 Chris Horner\par \par \uc2 Energy & \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Legal Institute\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 Investors focused on profits regularly stop investing in companies that are underperforming the market\u8212\'20\'14particularly when those companies produce products the global community has concluded threaten humanity. It was financially rational to stop investing in coal companies, the worst climate polluters, long before the leading companies went bankrupt. Like coal a few years back, oil and gas stocks have been underperforming the market for the last five years. For example, while the S&P 500 was up more than 80%, \uc2 Exxon Mobil\uc2  was down 6%. Where's the profit maximizing there? Moreover, the recent rise in oil prices Mr. Kessler notes has done little to lift oil stock prices. Besides, the \uc2 Rockefeller Family Fund\uc2  is a long-term investor and keeps its eye on the horizon.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of pure profit maximizing claim it best allocates resources, but they ignore externalities. Mr. Kessler therefore misses the simplest reason to unload oil and gas stocks. They have been woefully underperforming in the market and appear likely to continue to do so.\par \par \uc2 Lee Wasserman\par \par \uc2 Director, \uc2 Rockefeller Family Fund\par \par \uc2 New York\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 ccsr : \uc2 Corporate Social Responsibility | nlet : \uc2 Letters | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfce : \uc2 C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpex : \uc2 C&E Executive News Filter | niwe : \uc2 IWE Filter | nrgn : \uc2 Routine General News\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 namz : \uc2 North America | usa : \uc2 United States\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IPC\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 R/NME | R/US | XOM\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IPD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 WSJ | WSJ.com | WSJ.com Site Search | WSJAsia | WSJEurope | WSJ Japanese | Online | WSJ-PRO-WSJ.com | WSJSunday | SB108157377115177448737045840051021474410521 | Horner, Chris | SYND | CODES_REVIEWED | Letters\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document WSJO000020180129ee1t00360\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw272\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4080\pichgoal600

He's right. Over the 10 years ending 2017, annual returns on the average large-cap CSR fund were 7.8%, trailing the 8.5% return of the S&P 500 by 0.7%. But actively managed large-cap funds that don't consider CSR issues performed even worse, earning 7.7% per year and trailing the index by 0.8%. There may be valid objections to CSR funds, but over the past decade they've performed slightly better than their non-CSR peers. The S&P 500 remains a tough standard for all active managers to outpace.\par \par \uc2 John C.

That darker flip side involves a "climate risk disclosure" industry. Players in this "CRD" movement include state attorneys general, comptrollers and treasurers, and lawmakers combining with public pension funds, interest groups and, of course, contingency-fee lawyers. Even academics admit to expecting a taste of the expected settlement fund.\par \par \uc2 The campaign seeks to impede access to capital -- one player called it "divestment through value destruction." The effective goal is to coerce "confessions" in energy-related interests' public filings that catastrophic man-made global warming is a real problem of which they constitute a significant part, that their reserves are in fact worth little to nothing and their previous filings and other statements constitute actionable misdeeds, possibly fraud.\par \par \uc2 The "social investing" industry represents more than suspect fiscal responsibility. It also embodies the darker attributes of the climate and environmental industries.\par \par \uc2 Chris Horner\par \par \uc2 Energy & \b \highlight22\uc2 Environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  Legal Institute\par \par \uc2 Washington\par \par \uc2 ---\par \par \uc2 Investors focused on profits regularly stop investing in companies that are underperforming the market -- particularly when those companies produce products the global community has concluded threaten humanity. It was financially rational to stop investing in coal companies, the worst climate polluters, long before the leading companies went bankrupt. Like coal a few years back, oil and gas stocks have been underperforming the market for the last five years. For example, while the S&P 500 was up more than 80%, \uc2 Exxon Mobil\uc2  was down 6%. Where's the profit maximizing there? Moreover, the recent rise in oil prices Mr. Kessler notes has done little to lift oil stock prices. Besides, the \uc2 Rockefeller Family Fund\uc2  is a long-term investor and keeps its eye on the horizon.\par \par \uc2 Advocates of pure profit maximizing claim it best allocates resources, but they ignore externalities. Mr. Kessler therefore misses the simplest reason to unload oil and gas stocks.

But over the past decade this has changed. Businesses are aware that what they do has an impact on society and the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 This change has been reflected in the way that \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  and ethics are taught in UK business schools, particularly on MBA programmes. While MBA students expect to learn about finance, operations, marketing and strategy, an insight into to the latest CSR thinking and ethics is also expected.\par \par \uc2 But ethics is a difficult subject to teach and securing the attention of MBAs can be challenging. The subject requires the consideration of complex ideas and competing priorities. There is often no right or wrong answer. A company\u8217\'20\'19s success is measured by its bottom line, but how do you measure \u8220\'20\'1Cacting responsibly?\par \par \uc2 Emphasising personal accountability in the corporate \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  is one way of getting students\u8217\'20\'19 attention. Managers can no longer hide behind large corporate legal teams if they are caught acting unethically. In many cases, individuals are punished directly through loss of position, fines or even prison. Students understand, for their own and their company\u8217\'20\'19s interests, that managers must take responsibility for their actions.\par \par \uc2 Sceptics will argue that for businesses, earning a profit always trounces acting responsibly. But the reality is not always that simple.\par \par \uc2 After recognising that graduates needed a more thorough understanding of CSR, Leeds University Business School has refined its approach to teaching the subject. And it is one of a number of business schools \u8212\'20\'14 including Warwick, Cass and EDHEC \u8212\'20\'14 which signed up to the United Nations\u8217\'20\'19 Principles for Responsible Management Education. These principles encourage practical action to incorporate business ethics, environmental and sustainable development issues within curricular and student engagement activities.\par \par \uc2 In 2016, Leeds began compulsory assessment on CSR and ethics, after recognising graduates needed a more thorough understanding of the topics. MBA students undertake a research project as part of their programme and some use this as an opportunity to discuss and explore ethical issues by working with local educational organisations, social enterprises and charities (for example, Northern Ballet and St Gemma\u8217\'20\'19s Hospice).\par \par \uc2 Leeds students also carry out research to help them understand charitable giving and to explore the effectiveness of payroll giving to support this. Others have examined corporate CSR initiatives.\par \par \uc2 The students also work with the university\u8217\'20\'19s philosophy department through the Interdisciplinary Ethics Applied Centre. This has been very successful: philosophers offer a different perspective on ethical dilemmas and deepen the students\u8217\'20\'19 knowledge of ethical reasoning.\par \par \uc2 Business schools have a role to play in helping companies meet the challenges of social responsibility and ethics and in ensuring that their well-intentioned commitments are not disappointingly unfulfilled.\par \par \uc2 Professor Peter Moizer is executive dean of Leeds University Business School\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 ccsr : \uc2 Corporate Social Responsibility | gethic : \uc2 Ethical Issues | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | gcat : \uc2 Political/General News | gcom : \uc2 Society/Community | gsoc : \uc2 Social Issues | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfcpex : \uc2 C&E Executive News Filter\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 uk : \uc2 United Kingdom | eecz : \uc2 European Union Countries | eurz : \uc2 Europe | weurz : \uc2 Western Europe\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 The Financial Times Limited (AAIW/EIW)\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180206ee26001gz\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Net income ratio would rise 12 per cent to \u8364\'20\'AC6bn over the period of the plan from \u8364\'20\'AC3.8bn in 2017, and its payout ratio would fall from 85 per cent for 2018 to 70 per cent for 2021.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis is setting a new story of growth for \uc2 Intesa Sanpaolo\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Messina told investors on a conference call. \u8220\'20\'1CWe can play the game of being one of the top banks in Europe\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Mr Messina said the bank intended to pump more than \u8364\'20\'AC300bn into the Italian real economy by 2021, including mid- and long-term lending to Italian businesses.\par \par \uc2 Pro-forma fully loaded common equity tier 1 ratio would be 13.1 per cent in 2021, including regulatory impacts. \u8220\'20\'1CThere is no risk to the bank from the new regulatory \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr Messina said.\par \par \uc2 Operating costs would fall 0.9 per cent to \u8364\'20\'AC9.5bn over the course of the plan. Operating margin would increase to 9.1 per cent to \u8364\'20\'AC11.4bn in 2021.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIntesa has the best mix of revenues in Europe and one of the strongest capital in the industry. This creates a unique investment opportunity as there is a mix of quality of cash flow and dividends,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Davide Serra\uc2 , CEO and founder of Algebris, who owns equity and AT 1 securities in the bank.\par \par \uc2 Intesa\u8217\'20\'19s move to slash its holding of bad loans, in part by using some of its capital, comes after more than a year of pressure on the share prices of Italian bank stocks over their holdings of soured debt.\par \par \uc2 Eurozone bank supervisors signalled last autumn they intended to take an increasingly tough line on almost \u8364\'20\'AC1tn of NPLs left after the region\u8217\'20\'19s financial crisis. In a so-called addendum, the \uc2 European Central Bank\uc2  unveiled plans to require banks to hold more collateral against new lending that turned sour, and potentially for a backlog of bad loans.\par \par \uc2 Mr Messina acknowledged that Intesa\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cacceleration\u8221\'20\'1D in a plan to offload its bad loans could have an impact on other Italian lenders, pushing them to slash their bad loans at a faster rate than anticipated.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur NPL plan is unquestionably a point of reference for Italy,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 He also hit out at eurozone bank regulators for putting Italian banks under focus over their bad loans over the past two years, while predicting French and German banks would come under pressure for their holding of Level 2 and Level 3 assets in the coming months. Mr Messina\u8217\'20\'19s comments echo a \uc2 Bank of Italy\uc2  report published in December arguing the eurozone should be more careful about the opaque instruments.\par \par \uc2 Mr Messina also said the bank, a big donor to the arts in Italy, intended to be a \u8220\'20\'1Cworld class reference model\u8221\'20\'1D in \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 . This would include an initiative to provide \u8220\'20\'1Cfood and shelter for people in need\u8221\'20\'1D by allocating funds to pay for 10,000 meals a day, 6,000 dormitory beds a month and 3,000 items of medicine and clothes.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 nvoamb : \uc2 Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A.\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 i81402 : \uc2 Commercial Banking | i814 : \uc2 Banking | ibnk : \uc2 Banking/Credit | ifinal : \uc2 Financial Services\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 c151 : \uc2 Earnings | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | c15 : \uc2 Financial Performance | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfcpin : \uc2 C&E Industry News Filter\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 italy : \uc2 Italy | sicily : \uc2 Sicily | eecz : \uc2 European Union Countries | eurz : \uc2 Europe | medz : \uc2 Mediterranean | weurz : \uc2 Western Europe\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 The Financial Times Limited (AAIW/EIW)\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document FTCOM00020180206ee260070t\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw16\pich17\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal240\pichgoal255

Two months later, it also\u160\'00\'A0received a secretly filmed sex tape featuring GSK\u8217\'20\'19s China chief Mark Reilly. The company hired ChinaWhys, a risk-advisory firm based in Shanghai, to investigate Vivian Shi, its former head of government affairs, suspecting her at that time of a\u160\'00\'A0smear campaign.\u160\'00\'A0\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 ChinaWhys was run by Briton Peter Humphrey, a former journalist who had previously led China investigations for US risk consultancy Kroll and the accounting firm PwC, and his Chinese-born American wife Yu Yingzeng. Both were certified fraud investigators.\par \par \uc2 In June 2013, the Chinese government announced a bribery investigation into GSK China. In July, Humphrey and Yu were\u160\'00\'A0detained and charged with \u8220\'20\'1Cillegally acquiring personal information\u8221\'20\'1D of Chinese nationals. The story received huge attention internationally and, in August 2013, the couple were\u160\'00\'A0paraded on state TV, purportedly confessing. In a note dictated from prison in March 2014 and seen by the FT, Humphrey accused GSK of having failed to fully disclose the corruption allegations against the company when he agreed to work for them.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 In August 2014, he and Yu finally stood trial and\u160\'00\'A0were convicted and sentenced to 30 and 24 months in jail respectively. In a separate trial in September 2014, GSK China was found guilty of bribery and paid a fine of \u163\'00\'A3297m, upon which its detained executives were released.\u160\'00\'A0Humphrey was\u160\'00\'A0released from prison under diplomatic pressure in June 2015 amid reports of ill health, and he and Yu left the country.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This is his first personal account of the 23 months they spent in captivity.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I sat on the rough wooden floorboards of a spartan cell in the Shanghai Detention Centre, reading an old copy of FT Weekend that had been brought in by my consul, and shivering as winter approached. It\u8217\'20\'19s not the kind of spot the FT imagines its readers in. But in 2013, this floor \u8212\'20\'14 shared by 12 prisoners \u8212\'20\'14 was my breakfast, lunch and dinner table. I was reading an interview with Russia\u8217\'20\'19s most famous convict, oligarch\u160\'00\'A0\uc2 Mikhail Khodorkovsky\uc2 , who was stuck inside a frigid Siberian jail.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 It was a powerful article, which aroused comparisons to my own ordeal and spurred me to read more widely about captivity. During the 23 months I spent imprisoned in China, on false charges that were never proven in court, I consumed about 140 books, including jailbird classics such as Dostoyevsky\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0Crime and Punishment, Dumas\u8217\'20\'19\u160\'00\'A0Man in the Iron Mask, Solzhenitsyn\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, and modern equivalents such as Marina Nemat\u8217\'20\'19s\u160\'00\'A0Prisoner of Tehran. Mental fodder to help me endure my own predicament.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 This \u8220\'20\'1Cdetention centre\u8221\'20\'1D was once one of China\u8217\'20\'19s notorious \u8212\'20\'14 and supposedly now abolished \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1Ceducation through labour\u8221\'20\'1D prisons for miscreants in the Communist party-ruled dictatorship. Today, they pretend to be custody centres but they are still punishment centres. Untried prisoners are condemned from day one, starting with the dire conditions they face when they arrive. The aim is to isolate, crush the spirit, break the will. Many crumble quickly.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 My journey here began at the offices of my corporate investigation company in Shanghai on July 10 2013. I had living quarters there with my wife, Ying, and we were getting ready for our day. At 7am the Public Security Bureau (PSB) police flooded in, kicking our bedroom door into my face and injuring my neck. From that moment on, things moved ruthlessly fast: they ransacked the office, dismissed my staff, separated my wife and me from each other, and both of us from our teenage son Harvey. It would be two years before we were reunited.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Men in plain clothes drove us in unmarked black cars into the bowels of a hulking concrete building known as \u8220\'20\'1C803\u8221\'20\'1D, a feared headquarters of the Shanghai PSB. I was taken along underground corridors lined by dank interrogation cells, and through the gaps in doors saw prisoners slumped in metal chairs. When we reached my room, I sat in an interrogation chair with a lockable crossbar. PSB men came and went, asking questions about items found on our laptops. On a podium my confiscated mobile phone rang relentlessly but our son\u8217\'20\'19s frantic calls to us went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhere did you get this?\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CWhere did you get that?\u8221\'20\'1D The interrogators\u8217\'20\'19 questions were targeted. They knew what they wanted. As a business specialising in investigative work, we used code names. \u8220\'20\'1CWho\u8217\'20\'19s this agent? And his phone number?\u8221\'20\'1D Fifteen hours later, we sped out of the building in the dead of night. Ying and I were again in separate black cars. There was no word on where we were going. As we rode into a slum off the Hunan Road, a PSB man handcuffed me, saying, \u8220\'20\'1CI\u8217\'20\'19m sorry, I don\u8217\'20\'19t think you deserve this but I have orders from above.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 We halted in a dark alley before a towering gatehouse with one-foot-thick iron doors rolling into the walls on either side. The gates were guarded by paramilitaries of the People\u8217\'20\'19s Armed Police (PAP). Other PAP men patrolled the two-metre-thick perimeter walls. In a \u8220\'20\'1Ccheck-in\u8221\'20\'1D area, our pockets were emptied. I had to take off my jacket, shirt, slacks and Pierre Cardin shoes, and was photographed against a wall, front and side on. In the cell block, a warder made me strip to check I wasn\u8217\'20\'19t hiding anything \u8212\'20\'14 anywhere. He threw me some cotton shoes half my size and a smelly red vest with a \u8220\'20\'1CV\u8221\'20\'1D torn into its neck, and \u8220\'20\'1CShanghai Detention Centre\u8221\'20\'1D stamped on its back.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 At about 3am I was tossed into a sweltering cell. It was, I learnt, a ritual \u8212\'20\'14 new prisoners were always delivered at night. It reinforced the shock. Made them weaker. Easier to break, to extract confessions from. The warder shut the door with a clang and uncuffed me through the bars. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat\u8217\'20\'19s up?\u8221\'20\'1D mumbled a sleepy voice in Chinese from under a mound of pink bedclothes. \u8220\'20\'1CA new guy,\u8221\'20\'1D said another. A man in boxer shorts came to the door. \u8220\'20\'1CSleep there,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, dumping a dirty quilt on a narrow spot beside the toilet.\par \par \uc2 My head was bursting hot. Stunned and exhausted, I wept. Around the cell, shaved heads popped up like chicks from a nest to glimpse the commotion, then went back to sleep nonchalantly. A dozen or so bodies lay in rows on the rough boards, like sardines in cans with pink lids. A ceiling light burned brightly \u8212\'20\'14 in fact, it was never off. I felt winded. How could I sleep? Then suddenly it was light outside too. It must have crept up slowly but the new day came as a shock. My horror movie rolled to the next scene.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A low-pitched horn broke the silence. I hear it every day still. Bodies sat up. Warders on the corridor in pale-blue shirts banged on the bars. \u8220\'20\'1CQilai, qilai.\u8221\'20\'1D \u8220\'20\'1CGet up!\u8221\'20\'1D At breakfast the gritty rice and the briny smell of pickle made me retch. Some men had sachets of \u8220\'20\'1Ccereal\u8221\'20\'1D powder that they mixed with boiled water from an urn perched outside the bars. \u8220\'20\'1CHave one of my cereals,\u8221\'20\'1D said one inmate. Two men cleared the dishes and took them to the sink. Their actions were chores rostered to each detainee by the warder. Cleaning the floor, washing the dishes, scrubbing the toilet, stacking the boxes and quilts, emptying the urn twice a day for refilling, washing and folding the cloths. These jobs rotated each week.\par \par \uc2 The men exercised by circling the cell for 10 minutes like Tibetan pilgrims at a temple, minus the Buddhist chants. But this was no temple, just a floor five by three metres. The entrance and toilet added another two square metres. The toilet was a hole in the floor with a rusty flushing lever on the wall behind it. The sink was a heavy, cracked ceramic affair with a cold tap. Above it was a piece of shiny plastic, supposedly a mirror, warped so you couldn\u8217\'20\'19t see a clear image. During 14 months here, I did not see my own face.\par \par \uc2 After the \u8220\'20\'1Cstroll\u8221\'20\'1D came the toilet ritual. Orange vests sat on designated spots beside the wall. Red vests \u8212\'20\'14 new boys \u8212\'20\'14 faced the grille studying a brown rule book. We went to the toilet in turns, red vests last. Squatting over the hole I almost toppled as I reached for the flusher behind me. \u8220\'20\'1CTo shit, face forward; to piss, face the wall,\u8221\'20\'1D barked Li, the cell boss. \u8220\'20\'1CThat way, it falls the right way without a mess. You did it the wrong way.\u8221\'20\'1D Over the next 10 days, like a dog yapping at my ankles, Li ordered me to do this and do that. To learn the rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the men were kind; not all. On day 10, the warder ordered me to gather my things. \u8220\'20\'1CYou are going home,\u8221\'20\'1D said Li. The other men echoed his pronouncement and told me to put on proper clothes and dump my red vest. My heart rose. When the warder fetched me, he barked at Li, who had cruelly conned me \u8212\'20\'14 I was only moving cell. My heart sank.\par \par \uc2 They moved me to Cell 203 and gave me an orange vest. My new boss was Liu, 34, sentenced to 13 years for illegally owning guns to shoot rabbits. \u8220\'20\'1CMost people here committed crimes for money,\u8221\'20\'1D said Liu. \u8220\'20\'1CBut I am only here because of my hobby.\u8221\'20\'1D There were three Chinese in their late fifties like me, in the green vests worn by inmates with chronic illnesses. All three were wealthy businessmen, hostile to the political system. All were awaiting trial, accused of fraud; all claimed to have been framed. The cell was nicknamed \u8220\'20\'1Csick men\u8217\'20\'19s cell\u8221\'20\'1D by the others; I called it \u8220\'20\'1Cthe billionaires\u8217\'20\'19 cell\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cell, the rituals were the same. During exercises, which were aired on a closed circuit overhead TV, we imitated jumps and stretches performed by three PE coaches, one male, two female \u8212\'20\'14 the closest my cellmates ever got to a woman. Then a white-coated patrol doctor came by our grille. Inmates raised health issues but they would be lucky to get a dollop of ointment for a sore foot, or an aspirin.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Next came \u8220\'20\'1Cstudy time\u8221\'20\'1D. We sat cross-legged on red spots on the floor while the TV relayed \u8220\'20\'1Clessons\u8221\'20\'1D from the detention centre \u8220\'20\'1Cpropaganda department\u8221\'20\'1D. Sometimes it was the \u8220\'20\'1Cpropaganda director\u8221\'20\'1D preaching about good behaviour and analysing recent statistics: how many detainees had quarrelled or fought; how many inmates had argued with the guards or broken other rules, and been punished by isolation or prolonged squatting. Inmates sat quietly. Some would try sneak-reading a book. Others plotted how to handle their case, or dreamed. Nobody took \u8220\'20\'1Cstudy\u8221\'20\'1D seriously, though sometimes we had to write a commentary on the session.\par \par \uc2 That was our life. A waiting game. No family visits. No letters home. Just brief messages to lawyers. No chance to orchestrate a real defence. Foreign prisoners could receive consular visits, to the envy of Chinese cellmates. Usha, the vice-consul who visited me regularly, and her assistant Susie, relayed messages to and from my family, brought books and magazines, and lobbied over my health. They were my angels. In the detention centre I developed symptoms of prostate cancer, a long hernia, skin rashes, anal infections and constant diarrhoea, and endured an injury to my spine inflicted during the raid. None was treated.\par \par \uc2 There were frequent interrogations. For these I was locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage facing a podium where three PSB men questioned me and, once or twice, men from \u8220\'20\'1Ca different department\u8221\'20\'1D. Most of it was smoke. I had to thumb-print statements in red seal ink, and specimen documents from my project files. The PSB men did not want to hear any mitigating explanations. They tried to make it look as though Ying and I earned millions from trading in data, which we never did. Twice, the \u8220\'20\'1Cother department\u8221\'20\'1D men tried to stitch me up for spying. They tried to accuse me of spying in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. They tried to tie me to a US intelligence entity spying on North Korea.\par \par \uc2 After seven months, Ying and I were finally allowed to exchange jailbird love letters. They took a month to travel 30 metres through the concrete and three layers of police censorship. We were not allowed to discuss our case. Some of our letters were blocked without telling us. But I reminded myself that the Chinese men had no such privilege.\par \par \uc2 After 13 months without trial, I finally went to court on August 8 2014, where Ying and I were charged with \u8220\'20\'1Cillegally acquiring citizens\u8217\'20\'19 information\u8221\'20\'1D (which we denied). That day also saw one of the most deeply distressing moments of the entire ordeal. The police had told me shortly before our trial that Ying had been informed of the recent death of her brother, Bernard. So, on the morning of our trial, when I saw her on the stairs in the courthouse, I expressed my condolences. The manner in which she broke down told me instantly that they had lied. She didn\u8217\'20\'19t know. I believe they did this on purpose to destabilise us for the trial. We were predictably sent down, me for 30 months and Ying for 24.\par \par \uc2 From the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground. From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory. The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also \u8220\'20\'1Ctrained\u8221\'20\'1D prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.\par \par \uc2 Cell block eight was for foreign men, the adjacent block for Chinese. A tall iron fence sealed off a yard between the block\u8217\'20\'19s wings. A bald middle-aged Malaysian lifer came to the gate and helped carry my prison bags. His nickname was MC. He was block eight\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cking rat\u8221\'20\'1D. He ran a Malaysian mafia that controlled all the food and job assignments at Qingpu.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat are your thoughts?\u8221\'20\'1D a bespectacled senior officer asked me when I arrived. \u8220\'20\'1CI don\u8217\'20\'19t know what you mean,\u8221\'20\'1D I replied. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat will you do here?\u8221\'20\'1D he asked. I did not realise his questions were euphemisms for, \u8220\'20\'1CWill you write the acknowledgment of guilt and \u8216\'20\'18repentance report\u8217\'20\'19?\u8221\'20\'1D that was required of all prisoners. \u8220\'20\'1CI can teach some English to your staff,\u8221\'20\'1D I said innocently. I was led to the \u8220\'20\'1Ctraining cell\u8221\'20\'1D for new prisoners, and given blue-and-white-striped shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt with blue tabs, the summer prison uniform. I became prisoner number #42816.\par \par \uc2 My cell held 12 prisoners. We slept on iron bunks with wooden planks and a cotton \u8220\'20\'1Cmattress\u8221\'20\'1D one-and-a-half inches thick, covered with a coarse striped sheet. The barred windows were never closed. Winter was freezing. \u8220\'20\'1CI am the cell leader,\u8221\'20\'1D said a wiry young African, one of many Nigerians there, most convicted of drug smuggling and serving life terms.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 We were joined by two Chinese prisoners who held foreign citizenship: Zhang, an Austrian citizen serving a long term for people-trafficking; and Chen, a Thai citizen who was in jail for embezzlement. They were snitches who informed against everybody and who had been moved into the cell to monitor me. As both spoke some English, they would follow me everywhere, listen to any conversations I had and report back to the officers. Zhang managed the cell block\u8217\'20\'19s factory production; Chen worked as \u8220\'20\'1Csocial secretary\u8221\'20\'1D between prisoners and officers. \u8220\'20\'1CHow do sentence reductions work? How does the points system work?\u8221\'20\'1D I asked. \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t know, you must ask the captains,\u8221\'20\'1D they lied. \u8220\'20\'1CAt least, if you want to qualify for reduction, you must confess.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I spoke next to a Captain Liu. \u8220\'20\'1CWhat are your thoughts?\u8221\'20\'1D he said in broken English in a small interview room with bars separating us. My first thought was, \u8220\'20\'1CHere we go again.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI am innocent and I will not admit any crime,\u8221\'20\'1D I said. \u8220\'20\'1CIf I have to stay here, I will use my time to read. I can help teach people English if you want me to. I want to know about the sentence-reduction system.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Liu seemed awkward dealing with a grey-haired Englishman about his own age. \u8220\'20\'1CStudying is a privilege, not a right. You should write confession and repentance reports,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. He was more civilised than most warders and I think he genuinely hoped to have a good rapport with me. I disappointed him.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI will not write any of that,\u8221\'20\'1D I said. \u8220\'20\'1CAnd I demand medical treatment for my ailments, including my prostate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Zhang led me back to the cell. In the corridors and stairs other prisoners appeared. They smiled and nodded at me. On our corridor an African inmate tried to chat. \u8220\'20\'1CThey told us all not to talk to you,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CThey said you are an MI6 spy. None of us believes it. We saw your trial on TV. We have been waiting for you. You are a hero. If you need anything, tell us, we will help you,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, ignoring Zhang and Chen, who fluttered and clucked like anxious hens.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I had brought no toiletries, having been told I would get new ones. Instead, I had to buy them and I had no prison account, even though my warders handed over the money from my detention centre account to the prison. Initially, the officers also banned me from sending letters to family, making phone calls or using the prison shopping system. But I soon found a pile of things on my bunk \u8212\'20\'14 tissues, laundry powder, biscuits, coffee sachets, a small towel, two plastic rice bowls, pens and notepaper. Inmates dropped these things there as anonymous charity donations.\par \par \uc2 Zhang and Chen led me to my first supper in the \u8220\'20\'1Cworkroom\u8221\'20\'1D, where some 120 prisoners occupied rows of tables with backless, immovable seats attached. As I walked in, all eyes were on me, along with those of six officers. The food was warm here, sometimes hot. A standard dinner was a bowl of steamed rice, almost grit-free, stir-fry including a meat and a vegetable, and a thin soup. The Ritz! MC\u8217\'20\'19s gang served one cell at a time, ladling food from battered trays.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 After a final roll-call at 9pm, the barred cell door was locked and trusted prisoners from a Chinese block stood watch on the corridor to report nefarious activity or suicide bids. The ceiling light was kept on all night. We awoke at 6am. One of us cleaned the toilet area before the others rose.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A warder unlocked the cell and the men trooped down to the yard with Thermoses to collect boiled water for hot drinks or washing. Two flasks per man. For breakfast we ate plain rice congee or a steamed bun with salt pickles, and, every Sunday, a boiled egg. There was half-an-hour of exercise in the open air before breakfast in a yard the size of a basketball pitch.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 After a few days, nice Captain Liu vanished and word flew round that young Captain Wei would manage our cell. Wei was notorious for persecuting inmates and stirring up incidents that led prisoners to get a beating and to be dragged off screaming to solitary, which I witnessed over and over again. \u8220\'20\'1CThey are sending him here because of you,\u8221\'20\'1D I was told. Indeed, Wei summoned me several times a week for a \u8220\'20\'1Ctalk\u8221\'20\'1D. He tried to provoke my anger, insulted me, ordered me to write confessions, threatened me with an extended sentence or solitary if I refused. I never yielded.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Every week I cited my medical problems and demanded proper examinations and treatment for my prostate. \u8220\'20\'1CBut you haven\u8217\'20\'19t confessed,\u8221\'20\'1D he would say. He staged searches and threw all my things out of my bunk drawers across the cell. He often removed my private diary, so I played cat and mouse, keeping my notebook on my person. I agreed to write a separate monthly \u8220\'20\'1Crecord of my progress\u8221\'20\'1D for him, but I only listed his abuses. He would write \u8220\'20\'1Cgood\u8221\'20\'1D on each page like a teacher. He obviously did not understand my handwritten English.\par \par \uc2 The prison was a business, doing manufacturing jobs for companies. Mornings, afternoons and often during the after-lunch nap, prisoners \u8220\'20\'1Claboured\u8221\'20\'1D in the common room. Our men made packaging parts. I recognised well-known brands \u8212\'20\'14 \uc2 3M\uc2 , \uc2 C&A\uc2 , \uc2 H&M\uc2 . So much for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , though the companies may well have been unaware that prison labour was part of their supply chain. Prisoners from Chinese cell blocks worked in our factory making textiles and components. They marched there like soldiers before our breakfast and returned late in the evening. The foreigners who laboured in my cell block were Africans and Asians with no money from family, and no other way to buy toiletries and snacks. It was piece work; a hundred of this, a thousand of that. Full-time, they earned about Yn120 (\u163\'00\'A313.50) a month. But it was also about points. There was a sentence-reduction system based on points earned through labour \u8212\'20\'14 work such as floor cleaning, food serving, teaching and approved study. Snitching also earned favourable treatment.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 Once or twice a year a list of prisoners went up showing who had earned reductions. Those on long terms crowded around, praying their name was on the board. Many were disappointed. Reductions had become rarer since President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  had taken power in early 2013. Before that, a 10-year term might be cut to seven. Under Xi you would be lucky to get one year taken off. I never qualified because I boycotted the thought reports. The officers refused to explain the system to me anyway.\par \par \uc2 Between bouts of persecution by Wei, I read books and newspapers sent by my Rotary Club community, and books from the prison \u8220\'20\'1Clibrary\u8221\'20\'1D shelves managed by Stern Hu, a China-born Australian. Stern had led the China office of mining giant \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  before his arrest in 2009 on murky allegations of espionage and bribery, as China fought Australia over the price of iron ore. Ironically, I had commentated on his case on CNN at the time. Now I was his jailmate. Tall and aristocratic-looking, hair whitened by captivity, he was highly educated and very kind. He provided me with some of his warm clothing in winter and helped me with Chinese letter writing and reading. He was struggling with heart disease, and I worry about his health to this day.\par \par \uc2 Every encounter was an education. I had spent 15 years helping to prosecute fraudsters. Now, in prison, I met many people who might easily have been my investigation targets, but who I came to believe did not deserve such harsh sentences. I came away from my captivity with sympathy for both the innocent and the guilty.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 I continued to refuse to \u8220\'20\'1Cconfess\u8221\'20\'1D, and the captains continued to block my access to prostate treatment and warm clothing. Everybody was supposed to shave once or twice a week. Prisoners had their own razors, which were stored under lock and key. On certain days of the week the razors were handed out to their owners to shave and then handed back in immediately. I applied to have my family buy me a razor, but Wei kept blocking approval. They tried to make me use a shared razor. I refused on hygiene grounds. I grew a long straggly grey beard. Hair was cut every Saturday morning by prisoners. I let mine grow. Before long, I looked like a cross between Santa Claus and the Count of Monte Cristo. This drove Wei nuts. He tried to force me to shave, and I filed complaints to the prison and my consulate. Other prisoners started winking at me as I walked along the corridor and I noticed they had started to grow beards too.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 My consular saviours \u8212\'20\'14 Roslyn, who took over from Usha, and Susie \u8212\'20\'14 brought letters and books from relatives and friends each month, and relayed my complaints to the prison and the authorities. One day, they brought me a copy of the United Nations treaties on imprisonment and torture that I had requested. These confirmed to me that China failed to comply with most of the standards of treatment (on nutrition, sleep, labour, health, contact with family, etc) required by international laws that China had signed, and I urged my consul to complain. I shared the treaties among the inmates. Handwritten copies proliferated. Some of the men started citing the treaties in complaints to the governor. The officers began to grow uneasy and I could sense that some wanted to get shot of me. Wei continued to threaten me with solitary and made efforts to ban me from sitting down anywhere.\par \par \uc2 In April 2015, something shifted. Consular lobbying and my relentless complaints forced the prison to send me for a PSA blood test and an MRI at a local hospital. Wei used the moment to parade me in front of the public at hospital in handcuffs and prison uniform. But the MRI result was a milestone. Within weeks, they had to admit that I had a tumour in my prostate, although they concealed the result of the the blood test. The next step should have been a biopsy. Instead, they began to fake the paperwork for a sentence reduction for good behaviour.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 It emerged from this that the real commander of cell block eight was one Captain Shang. He, and eventually the prison governor, spent long sessions pleading with me to sign an admission of guilt so that I could leave prison with Ying, whose sentence would expire on July 9 that year. \u8220\'20\'1CEven your wife could get a small reduction too,\u8221\'20\'1D said Shang. He and I argued over the wording of a compromise statement that I would sign to satisfy the paperwork. He went back and forth to his superiors with my position. I finally signed a statement expressing qualified, conditional remorse if I had done anything wrong but not admitting that I had done anything wrong at all. Somehow they fudged it.\par \par \uc2 On June 4 2015, the prison smuggled me to the Shanghai Prison Hospital where I never saw a doctor but where they pretended I was getting medical attention for five days. The vice-governor came to me with a Gillette Turbo razor and begged me to use it. In my final act before leaving Qingpu, I shaved.\par \par \uc2 On June 9, they released Ying and me into house arrest in the Magnotel, a small hotel that sources said belonged to the security apparatus, pending our deportation. On June 17, the PSB men who had originally arrested and interrogated us in 2013 conveyed us to Pudong Airport to deport us on a Virgin flight to London. Just before we climbed aboard, the PSB handed us a bill for our nine-day stay in the Magnotel. We didn\u8217\'20\'19t have the cash with us, so we signed an \u8220\'20\'1CIOU\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 Postscript\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 After deportation to the UK in 2015, Peter Humphrey was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, and spent 18 months in cancer treatment and one year in PTSD treatment. He fought a 21-month legal battle against the Home Office over Yu\u8217\'20\'19s right to stay in the UK and won in court. He filed a detailed report to the Beijing government on Shanghai\u8217\'20\'19s abuse of China\u8217\'20\'19s judicial system and awaits a reaction. He and his wife have filed suit against GSK in US courts on racketeering charges. His damaged health has prevented his return to business and he has reverted to his journalistic and academic roots as a sinologist and writer. He was banned from China for 10 years but does not rule out a return when conditions are favourable.\par \par \uc2 Doing business in Xi\u8217\'20\'19s China\par \par \uc2 When Peter Humphrey was arrested by Chinese police in July 2013, the world still knew very little about China\u8217\'20\'19s new president and Communist party general secretary, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It seems naive now, but five years ago many people hoped Xi\u8217\'20\'19s administration would press ahead with difficult economic and perhaps even political reforms. The cases brought against Humphrey, his wife Yu Yingzeng and their corporate client GSK were some of the first indications that the international business community was about to enter uncharted territory as Xi quickly established himself as China\u8217\'20\'19s most powerful leader in decades.\par \par \uc2 GSK was one of the first corporate casualties of\u160\'00\'A0Xi\u8217\'20\'19s anti-corruption campaign, which has been unprecedented in scope. Shanghai police charged the UK company\u8217\'20\'19s staff with paying doctors billions of dollars in kickbacks.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey, a former Reuters reporter turned private investigator, was charged with illegally obtaining private information. His case was never officially connected to the GSK investigation, but few people doubted that he had appeared on the authorities\u8217\'20\'19 radar because of his work for the UK pharmaceutical giant.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey\u8217\'20\'19s ordeal also presaged a dramatic deterioration in\u160\'00\'A0China\u8217\'20\'19s human rights \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 .\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 His \u8220\'20\'1Cconfession\u8221\'20\'1D while under detention, which was broadcast by state television long before his trial, is now a common tactic employed in government prosecutions of Chinese human-rights lawyers, labour organisers and other activists.\par \par \uc2 By Tom Mitchell in Beijing\par \par \uc2 Inside China\u8217\'20\'19s prison system\par \par \uc2 According to the Ministry of Justice, under which the Bureau of Prison Administration operates, there are about 700 corrections facilities throughout China. The official reported rate of incarceration is 119 per 100,000, with 1,649,804 sentenced prisoners, but this statistic excludes pre-trial detainees and those held in administrative detention.\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 A 2009 report from the deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People\u8217\'20\'19s Procuratorate found that an additional 650,000 prisoners were held in detention centres throughout China.\par \par \uc2 Although the Chinese government officially states that its correctional institutions do not use torture as a method to extract information, a \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  report from 2015, quoted in a \uc2 US State Department\uc2  report, found \u8220\'20\'1Ccontinued widespread use of degrading treatment and torture by law enforcement authorities\u8221\'20\'1D and revealed: \u8220\'20\'1CSome courts continued to admit coerced confessions as evidence, despite the criminal procedure law, which restricts the use of unlawfully obtained evidence.\u8221\'20\'1D\u160\'00\'A0\par \par \uc2 The state department report went on to note \u8220\'20\'1Ca lack of due process in judicial proceedings, political control of courts and judges, closed trials, the use of administrative detention, failure to protect refugees and asylum seekers, extrajudicial disappearances of citizens, restrictions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs), discrimination against women, minorities, and persons with disabilities\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 By Ian Trueger\par \par \uc2 Follow\u160\'00\'A0@FTMag on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to find out about our latest stories first.

Two months later, it also received a secretly filmed sex tape featuring GSK's China chief Mark Reilly. The company hired ChinaWhys, a risk-advisory firm based in Shanghai, to investigate Vivian Shi, its former head of government affairs, suspecting her at that time of a smear campaign. ChinaWhys was run by Briton Peter Humphrey, a former journalist who had previously led China investigations for US risk consultancy Kroll and the accounting firm PwC, and his Chinese-born American wife Yu Yingzeng. Both were certified fraud investigators.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 In June 2013, the Chinese government announced a bribery investigation into GSK China. In July, Humphrey and Yu were detained and charged with "illegally acquiring personal information" of Chinese nationals. The story received huge attention internationally and, in August 2013, the couple were paraded on state TV, purportedly confessing.\par \par \uc2 In a note dictated from prison in March 2014 and seen by the FT, Humphrey accused GSK of having failed to fully disclose the corruption allegations against the company when he agreed to work for them.\par \par \uc2 In August 2014, he and Yu finally stood trial and were convicted and sentenced to 30 and 24 months in jail respectively. In a separate trial in September 2014, GSK China was found guilty of bribery and paid a fine of \u163\'00\'A3297m, upon which its detained executives were released.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey was released from prison under diplomatic pressure in June 2015 amid reports of ill health, and he and Yu left the country. This is his first personal account of the 23 months they spent in captivity. .\par \par \uc2 sat on a spa Centr that h and s It's no reade by 12 and d with Mikh a frigid Siberian jail.

During the 23 months I spent imprisoned in China, on false charges that were never proven in court, I consumed about 140 books, including jailbird classics such as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Dumas' Man in the Iron Mask, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, and modern equivalents such as Marina Nemat's Prisoner of Tehran. Mental fodder to help me endure my own predicament.\par \par \uc2 This "detention centre" was once one of China's notorious - and supposedly now abolished - "education through labour" prisons for miscreants in the Communist partyruled dictatorship. Today, they pretend to be custody centres but they are still punishment centres. Untried prisoners are condemned from day one, starting with the dire conditions they face when they arrive. The aim is to isolate, crush the spirit, break the will. Many crumble quickly.\par \par \uc2 My journey here began at the offices of my corporate investigation company in Shanghai on July 10 2013. I had living quarters there with my wife, Ying, and we were getting ready for our day. At 7am the Public Security Bureau (PSB) police flooded in, kicking our bedroom door into my face and injuring my neck. From that moment on, things moved ruthlessly fast: they ransacked the office, dismissed my staff, separated my wife and me from each other, and both of us from our teenage son Harvey. It would be two years before we were reunited.\par \par \uc2 Men in plain clothes drove us in unmarked black cars into the bowels of a hulking concrete building known as "803", a feared headquarters of the Shanghai PSB. I was taken along underground corridors lined by dank interrogation cells, and through the gaps in doors saw prisoners slumped in metal chairs. When we reached my room, I sat in an interrogation chair with a lockable crossbar. PSB men came and went, asking questions about items found on our laptops. On a podium my confiscated mobile phone rang relentlessly but our son's frantic calls to us went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 "Where did you get this?" "Where did you get that?" The interrogators' questions were targeted. They knew what they wanted. As a business specialising in investigative work, we used code names. "Who's this agent? And his phone number?" Fifteen hours later, we sped out of the building in the dead of night. Ying and I were again in separate black cars. There was no word on where we were going. As we rode into a slum offthe Hunan Road, a PSB man handcuffed me, saying, "I'm sorry, I don't think you deserve this but I have orders from above."\par \par \uc2 We halted in a dark alley before a towering gatehouse with one-foot-thick iron doors rolling into the walls on either side. The gates were guarded by paramilitaries of the People's Armed Police (PAP). Other PAP men patrolled the two-metrethick perimeter walls. In a "check-in" area, our pockets were emptied. I had to take offmy jacket, shirt, slacks and Pierre Cardin shoes, and was photographed against a wall, front and side on. Ying and I were taken to separate floors of the cell block. A warder made me strip to check I wasn't hiding anything - anywhere. He threw me some cotton shoes half my size and a smelly red vest with a "V" torn into its neck, and "Shanghai Detention Centre" stamped on its back.\par \par \uc2 At about 3am I was tossed into a sweltering cell. It was, I learnt, a ritual - new prisoners were always delivered at night. It reinforced the shock. Made them weaker. Easier to break, to extract confessions from. The warder shut the door with a clang and uncuffed me through the bars. "What's up?" mumbled a sleepy voice in Chinese from under a mound of pink bedclothes. "A new guy," said another. A man in boxer shorts came to the door. "Sleep there," he said, dumping a dirty quilt on a narrow spot beside the toilet.\par \par \uc2 My head was bursting hot. Stunned and exhausted, I wept. Around the cell, shaved heads popped up like chicks from a nest to glimpse the commotion, then went back to sleep nonchalantly. A dozen or so bodies lay in rows on the rough boards, like sardines in cans with pink lids. A ceiling light burned brightly - in fact, it was never off. I felt winded. How could I sleep? Then suddenly it was light outside too. It must have crept up slowly but the new day came as a shock. My horror movie rolled to the next scene.\par \par \uc2 A low-pitched horn broke the silence. I hear it every day still. Bodies sat up. Warders on the corridor in pale-blue shirts banged on the bars. "Qilai, qilai." "Get up!" At breakfast the gritty rice and the briny smell of pickle made me retch. Some men had sachets of "cereal" powder that they mixed with boiled water from an urn perched outside the bars. "Have one of my cereals," said one inmate. Two men cleared the dishes and took them to the sink. Their actions were chores rostered to each detainee by the warder. Cleaning the floor, washing the dishes, scrubbing the toilet, stacking the boxes and quilts, emptying the urn twice a day for refilling, washing and folding the cloths. These jobs rotated each week.\par \par \uc2 The men exercised by circling the cell for 10 minutes like Tibetan pilgrims at a temple, minus the Buddhist chants. But this was no temple, just a floor five by three metres. The entrance and toilet added another two square metres. The toilet was a hole in the floor with a rusty flushing lever on the wall behind it. The sink was a heavy, cracked ceramic affair with a cold tap. Above it was a piece of shiny plastic, supposedly a mirror, warped so you couldn't see a clear image. During 14 months here, I did not see my own face.\par \par \uc2 After the "stroll" came the toilet ritual. Orange vests sat on designated spots beside the wall. Red vests - new boys - faced the grille studying a brown rule book. We went to the toilet in turns, red vests last. Squatting over the hole I almost toppled as I reached for the flusher behind me. "To shit, face forward; to piss, face the wall," barked Li, the cell boss. "That way, it falls the right way without a mess. You did it the wrong way." Over the next 10 days, like a dog yapping at my ankles, Li ordered me to do this and do that. To learn the rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the men were kind; not all. On day 10, the warder ordered me to gather my things. "You are going home," said Li. The other men echoed his pronouncement and told me to put on proper clothes and dump my red vest. My heart rose. When the warder fetched me, he barked at Li, who had cruelly conned me - I was only moving cell. My heart sank.\par \par \uc2 They moved me to Cell 203 and gave me an orange vest.\par \par \uc2 My new boss was Liu, 34, sentenced to 13 years for illegally owning guns to shoot rabbits. "Most people here committed crimes for money," said Liu. "But I am only here because of my hobby." There were three Chinese in their late fifties like me, in the green vests worn by inmates with chronic illnesses. All three were wealthy businessmen, hostile to the political system. All were awaiting trial, accused of fraud; all claimed to have been framed. The cell was nicknamed "sick men's cell" by the others; I called it "the billionaires' cell".\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cell, the rituals were the same. During exercises, which were aired on a closed-circuit overhead TV, imitated jumps and stretches performed by three PE coaches, one male, two female - the closest my cellmates ever got to a .\par \par \uc2 . woman. Then a white-coated patrol doctor came by our grille. Inmates raised health issues but they would be lucky to get a dollop of ointment for a sore foot, or an aspirin.\par \par \uc2 Next came "study time". We sat cross-legged on red spots on the floor while the TV relayed "lessons" from the detention centre "propaganda department". Sometimes it was the "propaganda director" preaching about good behaviour and analysing recent statistics: how many detainees had quarrelled or fought; how many inmates had argued with the guards or broken other rules, and been punished by isolation or prolonged squatting. Inmates sat quietly. Some would try sneak-reading a book. Others plotted how to handle their case, or dreamed. Nobody took "study" seriously, though sometimes we had to write a commentary on the session.\par \par \uc2 That was our life. A waiting game. No family visits.\par \par \uc2 No letters home. Just brief messages to lawyers. No chance to orchestrate a real defence. Foreign prisoners could receive consular visits, to the envy of Chinese cellmates. Usha, the vice-consul who visited me regularly, and her assistant Susie, relayed messages to and from my family, brought books and magazines, and lobbied over my health. They were my angels. In the detention centre I developed symptoms of prostate cancer, a long hernia, skin rashes, anal infections and constant diarrhoea, and endured an injury to my spine inflicted during the raid. None was treated.\par \par \uc2 There were frequent interrogations. For these I was locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage facing a podium where three PSB men questioned me and, once or twice, men from "a different department". Most of it was smoke. I had to thumbprint statements in red seal ink, and specimen documents from my project files. The PSB men did not want to hear any mitigating explanations. They tried to make it look as though Ying and I earned millions from trading in data, which we never did. Twice, the "other department" men tried to stitch me up for spying. They tried to accuse me of spying in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. They tried to tie me to a US intelligence entity spying on North Korea.\par \par \uc2 After seven months, Ying and I were finally allowed to exchange jailbird love letters. They took a month to travel 30 metres through the concrete and three layers of police censorship. We were not allowed to discuss our case. Some of our letters were blocked without telling us. But I reminded myself that the Chinese men had no such privilege.\par \par \uc2 After 13 months without trial, I finally went to court on August 8 2014, where Ying and I were charged with "illegally acquiring citizens' information" (which we denied). That day also saw one of the most deeply distressing moments of the entire ordeal. The police had told me shortly before our trial that Ying had been informed of the recent death of her brother, Bernard. So, on the morning of our trial, when I saw her on the stairs in the courthouse, I expressed my condolences. The manner in which she broke down told me instantly that they had lied. She didn't know. I believe they did this on purpose to destabilise us for the trial. We were predictably sent down, me for 30 months and Ying for 24.\par \par \uc2 rom the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground. From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory. The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also "trained" prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.\par \par \uc2 Cell block eight was for foreign men, the adjacent block for Chinese. A tall iron fence sealed offa yard between the .\par \par \uc2 D O I N G B U S I N E S S I N X I 'S C H I N A When Peter Humphrey was arrested by Chinese police in July 2013, the world still knew very little about China's new president and Communist party general secretary, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It seems naive now, but five years ago many people hoped Xi's administration would press ahead with difficult economic and perhaps even political reforms. The cases brought against Humphrey, his wife Yu Yingzeng and their corporate client GSK were some of the first indications that the international business community was about to enter uncharted territory as Xi quickly established himself as China's most powerful leader in decades.\par \par \uc2 GSK was one of the first corporate casualties of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, which has been unprecedented in scope. Shanghai police charged the UK company's staffwith paying doctors hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey, a former Reuters reporter turned private investigator, was charged with illegally obtaining private information. His case was never officially connected to the GSK investigation, but few people doubted that he had appeared on the authorities' radar because of his work for the UK pharmaceutical giant.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey's ordeal also presaged a dramatic deterioration in China's human rights \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . His "confession" while under detention, which was broadcast by state television long before his trial, is now a common tactic employed in government prosecutions of Chinese human-rights lawyers, labour organisers and other activists. By Tom Mitchell in Beijing I N S I D E C H I N A'S P R I S O N SYS T E M According to the Ministry of Justice, under which the Bureau of Prison Administration operates, there are about 700 corrections facilities throughout China. The official reported rate of incarceration is 119 per 100,000, with 1,649,804 sentenced prisoners, but this statistic excludes pre-trial detainees and those held in administrative detention. A 2009 report from the deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate found that an additional 650,000 prisoners were held in detention centres throughout China.\par \par \uc2 Although the Chinese government officially states that its correctional institutions do not use torture as a method to extract information, a \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  report from 2015, quoted in a \uc2 US State Department\uc2  report, found "continued widespread use of degrading treatment and torture by law enforcement authorities" and revealed: "Some courts continued to admit coerced confessions as evidence, despite the criminal procedure law, which restricts the use of unlawfully obtained evidence."\par \par \uc2 The state department report went on to note "a lack of due process in judicial proceedings, political control of courts and judges, closed trials, the use of administrative detention, failure to protect refugees and asylum seekers, extrajudicial disappearances of citizens, restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), discrimination against women, minorities, and persons with disabilities". By Ian Trueger . block's wings. A bald middle-aged Malaysian lifer came to the gate and helped carry my prison bags. His nickname was MC. He was block eight's "king rat". He ran a Malaysian mafia that controlled all the food and job assignments at Qingpu.\par \par \uc2 "What are your thoughts?" a bespectacled senior officer asked me when I arrived. "I don't know what you mean," I replied. "What will you do here?" he asked. I did not realise his questions were euphemisms for, "Will you write the acknowledgment of guilt and 'repentance report'?" that was required of all prisoners. "I can teach some English to your staff," I said innocently. I was led to the "training cell" for new prisoners, and given blue-and-white-striped shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt with blue tabs, the summer prison uniform. I became prisoner number #42816.\par \par \uc2 My cell held 12 prisoners. We slept on iron bunks with wooden planks and a cotton "mattress" one-and-a-half inches thick, covered with a coarse striped sheet. The barred windows were never closed. Winter was freezing. "I am the cell leader," said a wiry young African, one of many Nigerians there, most convicted of drug smuggling and serving life terms.\par \par \uc2 We were joined by two Chinese prisoners who held foreign citizenship: Zhang, an Austrian citizen serving a long term for people-trafficking; and Chen, a Thai citizen who was in jail for embezzlement. They were snitches who informed against everybody and who had been moved into the cell to monitor me. As both spoke some English, they would follow me everywhere, listen to any conversations I had and report back to the officers. Zhang managed the cell block's factory production; Chen worked as "social secretary" between prisoners and officers. "How do sentence reductions work? How does the points system work?" I asked. "We don't know, you must ask the captains," they lied. "At least, if you want to qualify for reduction, you must confess."\par \par \uc2 I spoke next to a Captain Liu. "What are your thoughts?" he said in broken English in a small interview room with bars separating us. My first thought was, "Here we go again."\par \par \uc2 "I am innocent and I will not admit any crime," I said. "If I have to stay here, I will use my time to read. I can help teach people English if you want me to. I want to know about the sentence-reduction system."\par \par \uc2 Liu seemed awkward dealing with a grey-haired Englishman about his own age. "Studying is a privilege, not a right.\par \par \uc2 You should write confession and repentance reports," he said. He was more civilised than most warders and I think he genuinely hoped to have a good rapport with me. I disappointed him. "I will not write any of that," I said. "And I demand medical treatment for my ailments, including my prostate."\par \par \uc2 Zhang led me back to the cell. In the corridors and stairs other prisoners appeared. They smiled and nodded at me. On our corridor an African inmate tried to chat. "They told us all not to talk to you," he said. "They said you are an MI6 spy.\par \par \uc2 None of us believes it. We saw your trial on TV. We have been waiting for you. You are a hero. If you need anything, tell us, we will help you," he said, ignoring Zhang and Chen, who fluttered and clucked like anxious hens.\par \par \uc2 had brought no toiletries, having been told I would get new ones. Instead, I had to buy them and I had no prison account, even though my warders handed over the money from my detention centre account to the prison. The officers also banned me from sending letters to family, making phone calls or using the prison shopping system. But I soon found a pile of things on my bunk - tissues, laundry powder, biscuits, coffee sachets, a small towel, two plastic rice bowls, pens and notepaper. Inmates dropped these things there as anonymous charity donations.\par \par \uc2 Zhang and Chen led me to my first supper in the "workroom", where some 120 prisoners occupied rows of tables with backless, immovable seats attached. As I walked in, all eyes were on me, along with those of six officers. The food was warm here, sometimes hot. A standard dinner was a bowl of steamed rice, almost grit-free, stir-fry including a meat and a vegetable, and a thin soup. The Ritz! MC's gang served one cell at a time, ladling food from battered trays.\par \par \uc2 After a final roll-call at 9pm, the barred cell door was locked and trusted prisoners from a Chinese block stood watch on the corridor to report nefarious activity or suicide bids. The ceiling light was kept on all night. We awoke at 6am. One of us cleaned the toilet area before the others rose. A warder unlocked the cell and the men trooped down to the yard with Thermoses to collect boiled water for hot drinks or washing. Two flasks per man. For breakfast we ate plain rice congee or a steamed bun with salt pickles, and, every Sunday, a boiled egg. There was half-an-hour of exercise in the open air before breakfast in a yard the size of a basketball pitch.\par \par \uc2 After a few days, nice Captain Liu vanished and word flew round that young Captain Wei would manage our cell. Wei was notorious for persecuting inmates and stirring up incidents that led prisoners to get a beating and to be dragged offscreaming to solitary, which I witnessed over and over again. "They are sending him here because of you," I was told.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Wei summoned me several times a week for a "talk". He tried to provoke my anger, insulted me, ordered me to write confessions, threatened me with an extended sentence or solitary if I refused. I never yielded.\par \par \uc2 Every week I cited my medical problems and demanded proper examinations and treatment for my prostate. "But you haven't confessed," he would say. He staged searches and threw all my things out of my bunk drawers across the cell. He often removed my private diary, so I played cat and mouse, keeping my notebook on my person. I agreed to write a separate monthly "record of my progress" for him, but I only listed his abuses. He would write "good" on each page like a teacher. He obviously did not understand my handwritten English.\par \par \uc2 The prison was a business, doing manufacturing jobs for companies. Mornings, afternoons and often during the afterlunch nap, prisoners "laboured" in the common room. Our men made packaging parts. I recognised well-known brands - \uc2 3M\uc2 , \uc2 C&A\uc2 , \uc2 H&M\uc2 . So much for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , though the companies may well have been unaware that prison labour was part of their supply chain. Prisoners from Chinese cell blocks worked in our factory making textiles and components. They marched there like soldiers before our breakfast and returned late in the evening. The foreigners who laboured in my cell block were Africans and Asians with no money from family, and no other way to buy toiletries and snacks. It was piece work; a hundred of this, a thousand of that. Full-time, they earned about Rmb120 (\u163\'00\'A313.50) a month. But it was also about points. There was a sentence-reduction system based on points earned through labour - work such as floor cleaning, food serving, teaching and approved study. Snitching also earned favourable treatment.\par \par \uc2 Once or twice a year a list of prisoners went up showing who had earned reductions. Those on long terms crowded around, praying their name was on the board. Many were disappointed. Reductions had become rarer since President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  had taken power in early 2013. Before that, a 10-year term might be cut to seven. Under Xi you would be lucky to get one year taken off. I never qualified because I boycotted the thought reports. The officers refused to explain the system to me anyway.\par \par \uc2 ll ti etween bouts of persecution by Wei, I read books and newspapers sent by my Rotary Club community, and books from the prison "library" shelves managed by Stern Hu, a China-born Australian. Stern had led the China office of mining giant \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  before his arrest in 2009 on murky allegations of espionage and bribery, as China fought Australia over the price of iron ore. Ironically, I had commentated on his case on \uc2 CNN\uc2  at the time. Now I was his jailmate. Tall and aristocratic-looking, hair whitened by captivity, he was highly educated and very kind. He provided me with some of his warm clothing in winter and helped me with Chinese letter writing and reading. He was struggling with heart disease, and I worry about his health to this day.\par \par \uc2 Every encounter was an education. I had spent 15 years helping to prosecute fraudsters. Now, in prison, I met many people who might easily have been my investigation targets, but who I came to believe did not deserve such harsh sentences. I came away from my captivity with sympathy for both the innocent and the guilty.\par \par \uc2 I continued to refuse to "confess", and the captains continued to block my access to prostate treatment and warm clothing. Everybody was supposed to shave once or twice a week. Prisoners had their own razors, which were stored under lock and key. On certain days of the week the razors were handed out to their owners to shave and then handed back in immediately. I applied to have my family buy me a razor, but Wei kept blocking approval. They tried to make me use a shared razor. I refused on hygiene grounds. I grew a long straggly grey beard. Hair was cut every Saturday morning by prisoners. I let mine grow. Before long, I looked like a cross between Santa Claus and the Count of Monte Cristo. This drove Wei nuts. He tried to force me to shave, and I filed complaints to the prison and my consulate. Other prisoners started winking at me as I walked along the corridor and I noticed they had started to grow beards too.\par \par \uc2 My consular saviours - Roslyn, who took over from Usha, and Susie - brought letters and books from relatives and friends each month, and relayed my complaints to the prison and the authorities. One day, they brought me a copy of the United Nations treaties on imprisonment and torture that I had requested. These confirmed to me that China failed to comply with most of the standards of treatment (on nutrition, sleep, labour, health, contact with family, etc) required by international laws that China had signed, and I urged my consul to complain. I shared the treaties among the inmates. Handwritten copies proliferated. Some of the men started citing the treaties in complaints to the governor. The officers began to grow uneasy and I could sense that some wanted to get shot of me. Wei continued to threaten me with solitary and made efforts to ban me from sitting down anywhere.\par \par \uc2 In April 2015, something shifted. Consular lobbying and my relentless complaints forced the prison to send me for a PSA blood test and an MRI at a local hospital. Wei used the moment to parade me in front of the public at hospital in handcuffs and prison uniform. But the MRI result was a milestone. Within weeks, they had to admit that I had a tumour in my prostate, although they concealed the result of the blood test. The next step should have been a biopsy. Instead, they began to fake the paperwork for a sentence reduction for good behaviour.\par \par \uc2 It emerged from this that the real commander of cell block eight was one Captain Shang. He, and eventually the prison governor, spent long sessions pleading with me to sign an admission of guilt so that I could leave prison with Ying, whose sentence would expire on July 9 that year. "Even your wife could get a small reduction too," said Shang. He and I argued over the wording of a compromise statement that I would sign to satisfy the paperwork. He went back and forth to his superiors with my position. I finally signed a statement expressing qualified, conditional remorse if I had done anything wrong but not admitting that I had done anything wrong at all. Somehow they fudged it.\par \par \uc2 On June 4 2015, the prison smuggled me to the Shanghai Prison Hospital where I never saw a doctor but where they pretended I was getting medical attention for five days. The vice-governor came to me with a Gillette Turbo razor and begged me to use it. In my final act before leaving Qingpu, I shaved.\par \par \uc2 On June 9, they released Ying and me into house arrest in the Magnotel, a small hotel that sources said belonged to the security apparatus, pending our deportation. On June 17, the PSB men who had originally arrested and interrogated us in 2013 conveyed us to Pudong Airport to deport us on a Virgin flight to London. Just before we climbed aboard, the PSB handed us a bill for our nine-day stay in the Magnotel. We didn't have the cash with us, so we signed an "IOU".\par \par \uc2 P O S T S C R I P T After deportation to the UK in 2015, Peter Humphrey was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, and spent 18 months in cancer treatment and one year in PTSD treatment. He fought a 21-month legal battle against the Home Office over Yu's right to stay in the UK and won in court. He filed a detailed report to the Beijing government on Shanghai's abuse of China's judicial system and awaits a reaction. He and his wife have filed suit against GSK in US courts on racketeering charges. His damaged health has prevented his return to business and he has reverted to his journalistic and academic roots as a sinologist and writer.

Two months later, it also received a secretly filmed sex tape featuring GSK's China chief Mark Reilly. The company hired ChinaWhys, a risk-advisory firm based in Shanghai, to investigate Vivian Shi, its former head of government affairs, suspecting her at that time of a smear campaign. ChinaWhys was run by Briton Peter Humphrey, a former journalist who had previously led China investigations for US risk consultancy Kroll and the accounting firm PwC, and his Chinese-born American wife Yu Yingzeng. Both were certified fraud investigators.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 In June 2013, the Chinese government announced a bribery investigation into GSK China. In July, Humphrey and Yu were detained and charged with "illegally acquiring personal information" of Chinese nationals. The story received huge attention internationally and, in August 2013, the couple were paraded on state TV, purportedly confessing.\par \par \uc2 In a note dictated from prison in March 2014 and seen by the FT, Humphrey accused GSK of having failed to fully disclose the corruption allegations against the company when he agreed to work for them.\par \par \uc2 In August 2014, he and Yu finally stood trial and were convicted and sentenced to 30 and 24 months in jail respectively. In a separate trial in September 2014, GSK China was found guilty of bribery and paid a fine of \u163\'00\'A3297m, upon which its detained executives were released.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey was released from prison under diplomatic pressure in June 2015 amid reports of ill health, and he and Yu left the country. This is his first personal account of the 23 months they spent in captivity. .\par \par \uc2 sat on a spa Centr that h and s It's no reade by 12 and d with Mikh a frigid Siberian jail. It comparisons to my ow n the rough wooden floorboards of artan cell in the Shanghai Detention re, reading an old copy of FT Weekend had been brought in by my consul, shivering as winter approached. ot the kind of spot the FT imagines its ers in. But in 2013, this floor - shared 2 prisoners - was my breakfast, lunch dinner table. I was reading an interview Russia's most famous convict, oligarch hail Khodorkovsky, who was stuck inside t was a powerful article, which aroused wn ordeal and spurred me to read more widely about captivity. During the 23 months I spent imprisoned in China, on false charges that were never proven in court, I consumed about 140 books, including jailbird classics such as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Dumas' Man in the Iron Mask, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, and modern equivalents such as Marina Nemat's Prisoner of Tehran. Mental fodder to help me endure my own predicament.\par \par \uc2 This "detention centre" was once one of China's notorious - and supposedly now abolished - "education through labour" prisons for miscreants in the Communist partyruled dictatorship. Today, they pretend to be custody centres but they are still punishment centres. Untried prisoners are condemned from day one, starting with the dire conditions they face when they arrive. The aim is to isolate, crush the spirit, break the will. Many crumble quickly.\par \par \uc2 My journey here began at the offices of my corporate investigation company in Shanghai on July 10 2013. I had living quarters there with my wife, Ying, and we were getting ready for our day. At 7am the Public Security Bureau (PSB) police flooded in, kicking our bedroom door into my face and injuring my neck. From that moment on, things moved ruthlessly fast: they ransacked the office, dismissed my staff, separated my wife and me from each other, and both of us from our teenage son Harvey. It would be two years before we were reunited.\par \par \uc2 Men in plain clothes drove us in unmarked black cars into the bowels of a hulking concrete building known as "803", a feared headquarters of the Shanghai PSB. I was taken along underground corridors lined by dank interrogation cells, and through the gaps in doors saw prisoners slumped in metal chairs. When we reached my room, I sat in an interrogation chair with a lockable crossbar. PSB men came and went, asking questions about items found on our laptops. On a podium my confiscated mobile phone rang relentlessly but our son's frantic calls to us went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 "Where did you get this?" "Where did you get that?" The interrogators' questions were targeted. They knew what they wanted. As a business specialising in investigative work, we used code names. "Who's this agent? And his phone number?" Fifteen hours later, we sped out of the building in the dead of night. Ying and I were again in separate black cars. There was no word on where we were going. As we rode into a slum offthe Hunan Road, a PSB man handcuffed me, saying, "I'm sorry, I don't think you deserve this but I have orders from above."\par \par \uc2 We halted in a dark alley before a towering gatehouse with one-foot-thick iron doors rolling into the walls on either side. The gates were guarded by paramilitaries of the People's Armed Police (PAP). Other PAP men patrolled the two-metrethick perimeter walls. In a "check-in" area, our pockets were emptied. I had to take offmy jacket, shirt, slacks and Pierre Cardin shoes, and was photographed against a wall, front and side on. Ying and I were taken to separate floors of the cell block. A warder made me strip to check I wasn't hiding anything - anywhere. He threw me some cotton shoes half my size and a smelly red vest with a "V" torn into its neck, and "Shanghai Detention Centre" stamped on its back.\par \par \uc2 At about 3am I was tossed into a sweltering cell. It was, I learnt, a ritual - new prisoners were always delivered at night. It reinforced the shock. Made them weaker. Easier to break, to extract confessions from. The warder shut the door with a clang and uncuffed me through the bars. "What's up?" mumbled a sleepy voice in Chinese from under a mound of pink bedclothes. "A new guy," said another. A man in boxer shorts came to the door. "Sleep there," he said, dumping a dirty quilt on a narrow spot beside the toilet.\par \par \uc2 My head was bursting hot. Stunned and exhausted, I wept. Around the cell, shaved heads popped up like chicks from a nest to glimpse the commotion, then went back to sleep nonchalantly. A dozen or so bodies lay in rows on the rough boards, like sardines in cans with pink lids. A ceiling light burned brightly - in fact, it was never off. I felt winded. How could I sleep? Then suddenly it was light outside too. It must have crept up slowly but the new day came as a shock. My horror movie rolled to the next scene.\par \par \uc2 A low-pitched horn broke the silence. I hear it every day still. Bodies sat up. Warders on the corridor in pale-blue shirts banged on the bars. "Qilai, qilai." "Get up!" At breakfast the gritty rice and the briny smell of pickle made me retch. Some men had sachets of "cereal" powder that they mixed with boiled water from an urn perched outside the bars. "Have one of my cereals," said one inmate. Two men cleared the dishes and took them to the sink. Their actions were chores rostered to each detainee by the warder. Cleaning the floor, washing the dishes, scrubbing the toilet, stacking the boxes and quilts, emptying the urn twice a day for refilling, washing and folding the cloths. These jobs rotated each week.\par \par \uc2 The men exercised by circling the cell for 10 minutes like Tibetan pilgrims at a temple, minus the Buddhist chants. But this was no temple, just a floor five by three metres. The entrance and toilet added another two square metres. The toilet was a hole in the floor with a rusty flushing lever on the wall behind it. The sink was a heavy, cracked ceramic affair with a cold tap. Above it was a piece of shiny plastic, supposedly a mirror, warped so you couldn't see a clear image. During 14 months here, I did not see my own face.\par \par \uc2 After the "stroll" came the toilet ritual. Orange vests sat on designated spots beside the wall. Red vests - new boys - faced the grille studying a brown rule book. We went to the toilet in turns, red vests last. Squatting over the hole I almost toppled as I reached for the flusher behind me. "To shit, face forward; to piss, face the wall," barked Li, the cell boss. "That way, it falls the right way without a mess. You did it the wrong way." Over the next 10 days, like a dog yapping at my ankles, Li ordered me to do this and do that. To learn the rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the men were kind; not all. On day 10, the warder ordered me to gather my things. "You are going home," said Li. The other men echoed his pronouncement and told me to put on proper clothes and dump my red vest. My heart rose. When the warder fetched me, he barked at Li, who had cruelly conned me - I was only moving cell. My heart sank.\par \par \uc2 They moved me to Cell 203 and gave me an orange vest.\par \par \uc2 My new boss was Liu, 34, sentenced to 13 years for illegally owning guns to shoot rabbits. "Most people here committed crimes for money," said Liu. "But I am only here because of my hobby." There were three Chinese in their late fifties like me, in the green vests worn by inmates with chronic illnesses. All three were wealthy businessmen, hostile to the political system. All were awaiting trial, accused of fraud; all claimed to have been framed. The cell was nicknamed "sick men's cell" by the others; I called it "the billionaires' cell".\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cell, the rituals were the same. During exercises, which were aired on a closed-circuit overhead TV, imitated jumps and stretches performed by three PE coaches, one male, two female - the closest my cellmates ever got to a .\par \par \uc2 . woman. Then a white-coated patrol doctor came by our grille. Inmates raised health issues but they would be lucky to get a dollop of ointment for a sore foot, or an aspirin.\par \par \uc2 Next came "study time". We sat cross-legged on red spots on the floor while the TV relayed "lessons" from the detention centre "propaganda department". Sometimes it was the "propaganda director" preaching about good behaviour and analysing recent statistics: how many detainees had quarrelled or fought; how many inmates had argued with the guards or broken other rules, and been punished by isolation or prolonged squatting. Inmates sat quietly. Some would try sneak-reading a book. Others plotted how to handle their case, or dreamed. Nobody took "study" seriously, though sometimes we had to write a commentary on the session.\par \par \uc2 That was our life. A waiting game. No family visits.\par \par \uc2 No letters home. Just brief messages to lawyers. No chance to orchestrate a real defence. Foreign prisoners could receive consular visits, to the envy of Chinese cellmates. Usha, the vice-consul who visited me regularly, and her assistant Susie, relayed messages to and from my family, brought books and magazines, and lobbied over my health. They were my angels. In the detention centre I developed symptoms of prostate cancer, a long hernia, skin rashes, anal infections and constant diarrhoea, and endured an injury to my spine inflicted during the raid. None was treated.\par \par \uc2 There were frequent interrogations. For these I was locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage facing a podium where three PSB men questioned me and, once or twice, men from "a different department". Most of it was smoke. I had to thumbprint statements in red seal ink, and specimen documents from my project files. The PSB men did not want to hear any mitigating explanations. They tried to make it look as though Ying and I earned millions from trading in data, which we never did. Twice, the "other department" men tried to stitch me up for spying. They tried to accuse me of spying in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. They tried to tie me to a US intelligence entity spying on North Korea.\par \par \uc2 After seven months, Ying and I were finally allowed to exchange jailbird love letters. They took a month to travel 30 metres through the concrete and three layers of police censorship. We were not allowed to discuss our case. Some of our letters were blocked without telling us. But I reminded myself that the Chinese men had no such privilege.\par \par \uc2 After 13 months without trial, I finally went to court on August 8 2014, where Ying and I were charged with "illegally acquiring citizens' information" (which we denied). That day also saw one of the most deeply distressing moments of the entire ordeal. The police had told me shortly before our trial that Ying had been informed of the recent death of her brother, Bernard. So, on the morning of our trial, when I saw her on the stairs in the courthouse, I expressed my condolences. The manner in which she broke down told me instantly that they had lied. She didn't know. I believe they did this on purpose to destabilise us for the trial. We were predictably sent down, me for 30 months and Ying for 24.\par \par \uc2 rom the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground. From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory. The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also "trained" prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.\par \par \uc2 Cell block eight was for foreign men, the adjacent block for Chinese. A tall iron fence sealed offa yard between the .\par \par \uc2 D O I N G B U S I N E S S I N X I 'S C H I N A When Peter Humphrey was arrested by Chinese police in July 2013, the world still knew very little about China's new president and Communist party general secretary, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It seems naive now, but five years ago many people hoped Xi's administration would press ahead with difficult economic and perhaps even political reforms. The cases brought against Humphrey, his wife Yu Yingzeng and their corporate client GSK were some of the first indications that the international business community was about to enter uncharted territory as Xi quickly established himself as China's most powerful leader in decades.\par \par \uc2 GSK was one of the first corporate casualties of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, which has been unprecedented in scope. Shanghai police charged the UK company's staffwith paying doctors hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey, a former Reuters reporter turned private investigator, was charged with illegally obtaining private information. His case was never officially connected to the GSK investigation, but few people doubted that he had appeared on the authorities' radar because of his work for the UK pharmaceutical giant.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey's ordeal also presaged a dramatic deterioration in China's human rights \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . His "confession" while under detention, which was broadcast by state television long before his trial, is now a common tactic employed in government prosecutions of Chinese human-rights lawyers, labour organisers and other activists. By Tom Mitchell in Beijing I N S I D E C H I N A'S P R I S O N SYS T E M According to the Ministry of Justice, under which the Bureau of Prison Administration operates, there are about 700 corrections facilities throughout China. The official reported rate of incarceration is 119 per 100,000, with 1,649,804 sentenced prisoners, but this statistic excludes pre-trial detainees and those held in administrative detention. A 2009 report from the deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate found that an additional 650,000 prisoners were held in detention centres throughout China.\par \par \uc2 Although the Chinese government officially states that its correctional institutions do not use torture as a method to extract information, a \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  report from 2015, quoted in a \uc2 US State Department\uc2  report, found "continued widespread use of degrading treatment and torture by law enforcement authorities" and revealed: "Some courts continued to admit coerced confessions as evidence, despite the criminal procedure law, which restricts the use of unlawfully obtained evidence."\par \par \uc2 The state department report went on to note "a lack of due process in judicial proceedings, political control of courts and judges, closed trials, the use of administrative detention, failure to protect refugees and asylum seekers, extrajudicial disappearances of citizens, restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), discrimination against women, minorities, and persons with disabilities". By Ian Trueger . block's wings. A bald middle-aged Malaysian lifer came to the gate and helped carry my prison bags. His nickname was MC. He was block eight's "king rat". He ran a Malaysian mafia that controlled all the food and job assignments at Qingpu.\par \par \uc2 "What are your thoughts?" a bespectacled senior officer asked me when I arrived. "I don't know what you mean," I replied. "What will you do here?" he asked. I did not realise his questions were euphemisms for, "Will you write the acknowledgment of guilt and 'repentance report'?" that was required of all prisoners. "I can teach some English to your staff," I said innocently. I was led to the "training cell" for new prisoners, and given blue-and-white-striped shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt with blue tabs, the summer prison uniform. I became prisoner number #42816.\par \par \uc2 My cell held 12 prisoners. We slept on iron bunks with wooden planks and a cotton "mattress" one-and-a-half inches thick, covered with a coarse striped sheet. The barred windows were never closed. Winter was freezing. "I am the cell leader," said a wiry young African, one of many Nigerians there, most convicted of drug smuggling and serving life terms.\par \par \uc2 We were joined by two Chinese prisoners who held foreign citizenship: Zhang, an Austrian citizen serving a long term for people-trafficking; and Chen, a Thai citizen who was in jail for embezzlement. They were snitches who informed against everybody and who had been moved into the cell to monitor me. As both spoke some English, they would follow me everywhere, listen to any conversations I had and report back to the officers. Zhang managed the cell block's factory production; Chen worked as "social secretary" between prisoners and officers. "How do sentence reductions work? How does the points system work?" I asked. "We don't know, you must ask the captains," they lied. "At least, if you want to qualify for reduction, you must confess."\par \par \uc2 I spoke next to a Captain Liu. "What are your thoughts?" he said in broken English in a small interview room with bars separating us. My first thought was, "Here we go again."\par \par \uc2 "I am innocent and I will not admit any crime," I said. "If I have to stay here, I will use my time to read. I can help teach people English if you want me to. I want to know about the sentence-reduction system."\par \par \uc2 Liu seemed awkward dealing with a grey-haired Englishman about his own age. "Studying is a privilege, not a right.\par \par \uc2 You should write confession and repentance reports," he said. He was more civilised than most warders and I think he genuinely hoped to have a good rapport with me. I disappointed him. "I will not write any of that," I said. "And I demand medical treatment for my ailments, including my prostate."\par \par \uc2 Zhang led me back to the cell. In the corridors and stairs other prisoners appeared. They smiled and nodded at me. On our corridor an African inmate tried to chat. "They told us all not to talk to you," he said. "They said you are an MI6 spy.\par \par \uc2 None of us believes it. We saw your trial on TV. We have been waiting for you. You are a hero. If you need anything, tell us, we will help you," he said, ignoring Zhang and Chen, who fluttered and clucked like anxious hens.\par \par \uc2 had brought no toiletries, having been told I would get new ones. Instead, I had to buy them and I had no prison account, even though my warders handed over the money from my detention centre account to the prison. The officers also banned me from sending letters to family, making phone calls or using the prison shopping system. But I soon found a pile of things on my bunk - tissues, laundry powder, biscuits, coffee sachets, a small towel, two plastic rice bowls, pens and notepaper. Inmates dropped these things there as anonymous charity donations.\par \par \uc2 Zhang and Chen led me to my first supper in the "workroom", where some 120 prisoners occupied rows of tables with backless, immovable seats attached. As I walked in, all eyes were on me, along with those of six officers. The food was warm here, sometimes hot. A standard dinner was a bowl of steamed rice, almost grit-free, stir-fry including a meat and a vegetable, and a thin soup. The Ritz! MC's gang served one cell at a time, ladling food from battered trays.\par \par \uc2 After a final roll-call at 9pm, the barred cell door was locked and trusted prisoners from a Chinese block stood watch on the corridor to report nefarious activity or suicide bids. The ceiling light was kept on all night. We awoke at 6am. One of us cleaned the toilet area before the others rose. A warder unlocked the cell and the men trooped down to the yard with Thermoses to collect boiled water for hot drinks or washing. Two flasks per man. For breakfast we ate plain rice congee or a steamed bun with salt pickles, and, every Sunday, a boiled egg. There was half-an-hour of exercise in the open air before breakfast in a yard the size of a basketball pitch.\par \par \uc2 After a few days, nice Captain Liu vanished and word flew round that young Captain Wei would manage our cell. Wei was notorious for persecuting inmates and stirring up incidents that led prisoners to get a beating and to be dragged offscreaming to solitary, which I witnessed over and over again. "They are sending him here because of you," I was told.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Wei summoned me several times a week for a "talk". He tried to provoke my anger, insulted me, ordered me to write confessions, threatened me with an extended sentence or solitary if I refused. I never yielded.\par \par \uc2 Every week I cited my medical problems and demanded proper examinations and treatment for my prostate. "But you haven't confessed," he would say. He staged searches and threw all my things out of my bunk drawers across the cell. He often removed my private diary, so I played cat and mouse, keeping my notebook on my person. I agreed to write a separate monthly "record of my progress" for him, but I only listed his abuses. He would write "good" on each page like a teacher. He obviously did not understand my handwritten English.\par \par \uc2 The prison was a business, doing manufacturing jobs for companies. Mornings, afternoons and often during the afterlunch nap, prisoners "laboured" in the common room. Our men made packaging parts. I recognised well-known brands - \uc2 3M\uc2 , \uc2 C&A\uc2 , \uc2 H&M\uc2 . So much for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , though the companies may well have been unaware that prison labour was part of their supply chain. Prisoners from Chinese cell blocks worked in our factory making textiles and components. They marched there like soldiers before our breakfast and returned late in the evening. The foreigners who laboured in my cell block were Africans and Asians with no money from family, and no other way to buy toiletries and snacks. It was piece work; a hundred of this, a thousand of that. Full-time, they earned about Rmb120 (\u163\'00\'A313.50) a month. But it was also about points. There was a sentence-reduction system based on points earned through labour - work such as floor cleaning, food serving, teaching and approved study. Snitching also earned favourable treatment.\par \par \uc2 Once or twice a year a list of prisoners went up showing who had earned reductions. Those on long terms crowded around, praying their name was on the board. Many were disappointed. Reductions had become rarer since President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  had taken power in early 2013. Before that, a 10-year term might be cut to seven. Under Xi you would be lucky to get one year taken off. I never qualified because I boycotted the thought reports. The officers refused to explain the system to me anyway.\par \par \uc2 ll ti etween bouts of persecution by Wei, I read books and newspapers sent by my Rotary Club community, and books from the prison "library" shelves managed by Stern Hu, a China-born Australian. Stern had led the China office of mining giant \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  before his arrest in 2009 on murky allegations of espionage and bribery, as China fought Australia over the price of iron ore. Ironically, I had commentated on his case on \uc2 CNN\uc2  at the time. Now I was his jailmate. Tall and aristocratic-looking, hair whitened by captivity, he was highly educated and very kind. He provided me with some of his warm clothing in winter and helped me with Chinese letter writing and reading. He was struggling with heart disease, and I worry about his health to this day.\par \par \uc2 Every encounter was an education. I had spent 15 years helping to prosecute fraudsters. Now, in prison, I met many people who might easily have been my investigation targets, but who I came to believe did not deserve such harsh sentences. I came away from my captivity with sympathy for both the innocent and the guilty.\par \par \uc2 I continued to refuse to "confess", and the captains continued to block my access to prostate treatment and warm clothing. Everybody was supposed to shave once or twice a week. Prisoners had their own razors, which were stored under lock and key. On certain days of the week the razors were handed out to their owners to shave and then handed back in immediately. I applied to have my family buy me a razor, but Wei kept blocking approval. They tried to make me use a shared razor. I refused on hygiene grounds. I grew a long straggly grey beard. Hair was cut every Saturday morning by prisoners. I let mine grow. Before long, I looked like a cross between Santa Claus and the Count of Monte Cristo. This drove Wei nuts. He tried to force me to shave, and I filed complaints to the prison and my consulate. Other prisoners started winking at me as I walked along the corridor and I noticed they had started to grow beards too.\par \par \uc2 My consular saviours - Roslyn, who took over from Usha, and Susie - brought letters and books from relatives and friends each month, and relayed my complaints to the prison and the authorities. One day, they brought me a copy of the United Nations treaties on imprisonment and torture that I had requested. These confirmed to me that China failed to comply with most of the standards of treatment (on nutrition, sleep, labour, health, contact with family, etc) required by international laws that China had signed, and I urged my consul to complain. I shared the treaties among the inmates. Handwritten copies proliferated. Some of the men started citing the treaties in complaints to the governor. The officers began to grow uneasy and I could sense that some wanted to get shot of me. Wei continued to threaten me with solitary and made efforts to ban me from sitting down anywhere.\par \par \uc2 In April 2015, something shifted. Consular lobbying and my relentless complaints forced the prison to send me for a PSA blood test and an MRI at a local hospital. Wei used the moment to parade me in front of the public at hospital in handcuffs and prison uniform. But the MRI result was a milestone. Within weeks, they had to admit that I had a tumour in my prostate, although they concealed the result of the blood test. The next step should have been a biopsy. Instead, they began to fake the paperwork for a sentence reduction for good behaviour.\par \par \uc2 It emerged from this that the real commander of cell block eight was one Captain Shang. He, and eventually the prison governor, spent long sessions pleading with me to sign an admission of guilt so that I could leave prison with Ying, whose sentence would expire on July 9 that year. "Even your wife could get a small reduction too," said Shang. He and I argued over the wording of a compromise statement that I would sign to satisfy the paperwork. He went back and forth to his superiors with my position. I finally signed a statement expressing qualified, conditional remorse if I had done anything wrong but not admitting that I had done anything wrong at all. Somehow they fudged it.\par \par \uc2 On June 4 2015, the prison smuggled me to the Shanghai Prison Hospital where I never saw a doctor but where they pretended I was getting medical attention for five days. The vice-governor came to me with a Gillette Turbo razor and begged me to use it. In my final act before leaving Qingpu, I shaved.\par \par \uc2 On June 9, they released Ying and me into house arrest in the Magnotel, a small hotel that sources said belonged to the security apparatus, pending our deportation. On June 17, the PSB men who had originally arrested and interrogated us in 2013 conveyed us to Pudong Airport to deport us on a Virgin flight to London. Just before we climbed aboard, the PSB handed us a bill for our nine-day stay in the Magnotel. We didn't have the cash with us, so we signed an "IOU".\par \par \uc2 P O S T S C R I P T After deportation to the UK in 2015, Peter Humphrey was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, and spent 18 months in cancer treatment and one year in PTSD treatment. He fought a 21-month legal battle against the Home Office over Yu's right to stay in the UK and won in court. He filed a detailed report to the Beijing government on Shanghai's abuse of China's judicial system and awaits a reaction. He and his wife have filed suit against GSK in US courts on racketeering charges. His damaged health has prevented his return to business and he has reverted to his journalistic and academic roots as a sinologist and writer. He was banned from China for 10 years but does not rule out a return when conditions are favourable.\par \par \uc2 Peter Humphrey: my time in a Chinese prison A personal account of 23 months spent in captivity.ft.com/humphrey V I D E O\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 glxo : \uc2 GlaxoSmithKline PLC\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 i257 : \uc2 Pharmaceuticals | i951 : \uc2 Health Care/Life Sciences\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 gfinc : \uc2 Financial Crime | gpris : \uc2 Prisons/Prisoners | gfraud : \uc2 Fraud | c12 : \uc2 Corporate Crime/Legal Action | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | gcat : \uc2 Political/General News | gcns : \uc2 National/Public Security | gcrim : \uc2 Crime/Legal Action | ghome : \uc2 Law Enforcement | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfcpex : \uc2 C&E Executive News Filter | nfcpin : \uc2 C&E Industry News Filter\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 china : \uc2 China | uk : \uc2 United Kingdom | usa : \uc2 United States | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | asiaz : \uc2 Asia | bric : \uc2 BRICS Countries | chinaz : \uc2 Greater China | devgcoz : \uc2 Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : \uc2 Developing Economies | easiaz : \uc2 Eastern Asia | eecz : \uc2 European Union Countries | eurz : \uc2 Europe | namz : \uc2 North America | weurz : \uc2 Western Europe\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 The Financial Times Limited (AAIW/EIW)\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document FTFT000020180217ee2h000jg\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Two months later, it also received a secretly filmed sex tape featuring GSK's China chief Mark Reilly. The company hired ChinaWhys, a risk-advisory firm based in Shanghai, to investigate Vivian Shi, its former head of government affairs, suspecting her at that time of a smear campaign. ChinaWhys was run by Briton Peter Humphrey, a former journalist who had previously led China investigations for US risk consultancy Kroll and the accounting firm PwC, and his Chinese-born American wife Yu Yingzeng. Both were certified fraud investigators.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 In June 2013, the Chinese government announced a bribery investigation into GSK China. In July, Humphrey and Yu were detained and charged with "illegally acquiring personal information" of Chinese nationals. The story received huge attention internationally and, in August 2013, the couple were paraded on state TV, purportedly confessing.\par \par \uc2 In a note dictated from prison in March 2014 and seen by the FT, Humphrey accused GSK of having failed to fully disclose the corruption allegations against the company when he agreed to work for them.\par \par \uc2 In August 2014, he and Yu finally stood trial and were convicted and sentenced to 30 and 24 months in jail respectively. In a separate trial in September 2014, GSK China was found guilty of bribery and paid a fine of \u163\'00\'A3297m, upon which its detained executives were released.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey was released from prison under diplomatic pressure in June 2015 amid reports of ill health, and he and Yu left the country. This is his first personal account of the 23 months they spent in captivity. .\par \par \uc2 sat on a spa Centr that h and s It's no reade by 12 and d with Mikh a frigid Siberian jail. It comparisons to my ow n the rough wooden floorboards of artan cell in the Shanghai Detention re, reading an old copy of FT Weekend had been brought in by my consul, shivering as winter approached. ot the kind of spot the FT imagines its ers in. But in 2013, this floor - shared 2 prisoners - was my breakfast, lunch dinner table. I was reading an interview Russia's most famous convict, oligarch hail Khodorkovsky, who was stuck inside t was a powerful article, which aroused wn ordeal and spurred me to read more widely about captivity. During the 23 months I spent imprisoned in China, on false charges that were never proven in court, I consumed about 140 books, including jailbird classics such as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Dumas' Man in the Iron Mask, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, and modern equivalents such as Marina Nemat's Prisoner of Tehran. Mental fodder to help me endure my own predicament.\par \par \uc2 This "detention centre" was once one of China's notorious - and supposedly now abolished - "education through labour" prisons for miscreants in the Communist partyruled dictatorship. Today, they pretend to be custody centres but they are still punishment centres. Untried prisoners are condemned from day one, starting with the dire conditions they face when they arrive. The aim is to isolate, crush the spirit, break the will. Many crumble quickly.\par \par \uc2 My journey here began at the offices of my corporate investigation company in Shanghai on July 10 2013. I had living quarters there with my wife, Ying, and we were getting ready for our day. At 7am the Public Security Bureau (PSB) police flooded in, kicking our bedroom door into my face and injuring my neck. From that moment on, things moved ruthlessly fast: they ransacked the office, dismissed my staff, separated my wife and me from each other, and both of us from our teenage son Harvey. It would be two years before we were reunited.\par \par \uc2 Men in plain clothes drove us in unmarked black cars into the bowels of a hulking concrete building known as "803", a feared headquarters of the Shanghai PSB. I was taken along underground corridors lined by dank interrogation cells, and through the gaps in doors saw prisoners slumped in metal chairs. When we reached my room, I sat in an interrogation chair with a lockable crossbar. PSB men came and went, asking questions about items found on our laptops. On a podium my confiscated mobile phone rang relentlessly but our son's frantic calls to us went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 "Where did you get this?" "Where did you get that?" The interrogators' questions were targeted. They knew what they wanted. As a business specialising in investigative work, we used code names. "Who's this agent? And his phone number?" Fifteen hours later, we sped out of the building in the dead of night. Ying and I were again in separate black cars. There was no word on where we were going. As we rode into a slum offthe Hunan Road, a PSB man handcuffed me, saying, "I'm sorry, I don't think you deserve this but I have orders from above."\par \par \uc2 We halted in a dark alley before a towering gatehouse with one-foot-thick iron doors rolling into the walls on either side. The gates were guarded by paramilitaries of the People's Armed Police (PAP). Other PAP men patrolled the two-metrethick perimeter walls. In a "check-in" area, our pockets were emptied. I had to take offmy jacket, shirt, slacks and Pierre Cardin shoes, and was photographed against a wall, front and side on. Ying and I were taken to separate floors of the cell block. A warder made me strip to check I wasn't hiding anything - anywhere. He threw me some cotton shoes half my size and a smelly red vest with a "V" torn into its neck, and "Shanghai Detention Centre" stamped on its back.\par \par \uc2 At about 3am I was tossed into a sweltering cell. It was, I learnt, a ritual - new prisoners were always delivered at night. It reinforced the shock. Made them weaker. Easier to break, to extract confessions from. The warder shut the door with a clang and uncuffed me through the bars. "What's up?" mumbled a sleepy voice in Chinese from under a mound of pink bedclothes. "A new guy," said another. A man in boxer shorts came to the door. "Sleep there," he said, dumping a dirty quilt on a narrow spot beside the toilet.\par \par \uc2 My head was bursting hot. Stunned and exhausted, I wept. Around the cell, shaved heads popped up like chicks from a nest to glimpse the commotion, then went back to sleep nonchalantly. A dozen or so bodies lay in rows on the rough boards, like sardines in cans with pink lids. A ceiling light burned brightly - in fact, it was never off. I felt winded. How could I sleep? Then suddenly it was light outside too. It must have crept up slowly but the new day came as a shock. My horror movie rolled to the next scene.\par \par \uc2 A low-pitched horn broke the silence. I hear it every day still. Bodies sat up. Warders on the corridor in pale-blue shirts banged on the bars. "Qilai, qilai." "Get up!" At breakfast the gritty rice and the briny smell of pickle made me retch. Some men had sachets of "cereal" powder that they mixed with boiled water from an urn perched outside the bars. "Have one of my cereals," said one inmate. Two men cleared the dishes and took them to the sink. Their actions were chores rostered to each detainee by the warder. Cleaning the floor, washing the dishes, scrubbing the toilet, stacking the boxes and quilts, emptying the urn twice a day for refilling, washing and folding the cloths. These jobs rotated each week.\par \par \uc2 The men exercised by circling the cell for 10 minutes like Tibetan pilgrims at a temple, minus the Buddhist chants. But this was no temple, just a floor five by three metres. The entrance and toilet added another two square metres. The toilet was a hole in the floor with a rusty flushing lever on the wall behind it. The sink was a heavy, cracked ceramic affair with a cold tap. Above it was a piece of shiny plastic, supposedly a mirror, warped so you couldn't see a clear image. During 14 months here, I did not see my own face.\par \par \uc2 After the "stroll" came the toilet ritual. Orange vests sat on designated spots beside the wall. Red vests - new boys - faced the grille studying a brown rule book. We went to the toilet in turns, red vests last. Squatting over the hole I almost toppled as I reached for the flusher behind me. "To shit, face forward; to piss, face the wall," barked Li, the cell boss. "That way, it falls the right way without a mess. You did it the wrong way." Over the next 10 days, like a dog yapping at my ankles, Li ordered me to do this and do that. To learn the rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the men were kind; not all. On day 10, the warder ordered me to gather my things. "You are going home," said Li. The other men echoed his pronouncement and told me to put on proper clothes and dump my red vest. My heart rose. When the warder fetched me, he barked at Li, who had cruelly conned me - I was only moving cell. My heart sank.\par \par \uc2 They moved me to Cell 203 and gave me an orange vest.\par \par \uc2 My new boss was Liu, 34, sentenced to 13 years for illegally owning guns to shoot rabbits. "Most people here committed crimes for money," said Liu. "But I am only here because of my hobby." There were three Chinese in their late fifties like me, in the green vests worn by inmates with chronic illnesses. All three were wealthy businessmen, hostile to the political system. All were awaiting trial, accused of fraud; all claimed to have been framed. The cell was nicknamed "sick men's cell" by the others; I called it "the billionaires' cell".\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cell, the rituals were the same. During exercises, which were aired on a closed-circuit overhead TV, imitated jumps and stretches performed by three PE coaches, one male, two female - the closest my cellmates ever got to a .\par \par \uc2 . woman. Then a white-coated patrol doctor came by our grille. Inmates raised health issues but they would be lucky to get a dollop of ointment for a sore foot, or an aspirin.\par \par \uc2 Next came "study time". We sat cross-legged on red spots on the floor while the TV relayed "lessons" from the detention centre "propaganda department". Sometimes it was the "propaganda director" preaching about good behaviour and analysing recent statistics: how many detainees had quarrelled or fought; how many inmates had argued with the guards or broken other rules, and been punished by isolation or prolonged squatting. Inmates sat quietly. Some would try sneak-reading a book. Others plotted how to handle their case, or dreamed. Nobody took "study" seriously, though sometimes we had to write a commentary on the session.\par \par \uc2 That was our life. A waiting game. No family visits.\par \par \uc2 No letters home. Just brief messages to lawyers. No chance to orchestrate a real defence. Foreign prisoners could receive consular visits, to the envy of Chinese cellmates. Usha, the vice-consul who visited me regularly, and her assistant Susie, relayed messages to and from my family, brought books and magazines, and lobbied over my health. They were my angels. In the detention centre I developed symptoms of prostate cancer, a long hernia, skin rashes, anal infections and constant diarrhoea, and endured an injury to my spine inflicted during the raid. None was treated.\par \par \uc2 There were frequent interrogations. For these I was locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage facing a podium where three PSB men questioned me and, once or twice, men from "a different department". Most of it was smoke. I had to thumbprint statements in red seal ink, and specimen documents from my project files. The PSB men did not want to hear any mitigating explanations. They tried to make it look as though Ying and I earned millions from trading in data, which we never did. Twice, the "other department" men tried to stitch me up for spying. They tried to accuse me of spying in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. They tried to tie me to a US intelligence entity spying on North Korea.\par \par \uc2 After seven months, Ying and I were finally allowed to exchange jailbird love letters. They took a month to travel 30 metres through the concrete and three layers of police censorship. We were not allowed to discuss our case. Some of our letters were blocked without telling us. But I reminded myself that the Chinese men had no such privilege.\par \par \uc2 After 13 months without trial, I finally went to court on August 8 2014, where Ying and I were charged with "illegally acquiring citizens' information" (which we denied). That day also saw one of the most deeply distressing moments of the entire ordeal. The police had told me shortly before our trial that Ying had been informed of the recent death of her brother, Bernard. So, on the morning of our trial, when I saw her on the stairs in the courthouse, I expressed my condolences. The manner in which she broke down told me instantly that they had lied. She didn't know. I believe they did this on purpose to destabilise us for the trial. We were predictably sent down, me for 30 months and Ying for 24.\par \par \uc2 rom the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground. From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory. The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also "trained" prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.\par \par \uc2 Cell block eight was for foreign men, the adjacent block for Chinese. A tall iron fence sealed offa yard between the .\par \par \uc2 D O I N G B U S I N E S S I N X I 'S C H I N A When Peter Humphrey was arrested by Chinese police in July 2013, the world still knew very little about China's new president and Communist party general secretary, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It seems naive now, but five years ago many people hoped Xi's administration would press ahead with difficult economic and perhaps even political reforms. The cases brought against Humphrey, his wife Yu Yingzeng and their corporate client GSK were some of the first indications that the international business community was about to enter uncharted territory as Xi quickly established himself as China's most powerful leader in decades.\par \par \uc2 GSK was one of the first corporate casualties of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, which has been unprecedented in scope. Shanghai police charged the UK company's staffwith paying doctors hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey, a former Reuters reporter turned private investigator, was charged with illegally obtaining private information. His case was never officially connected to the GSK investigation, but few people doubted that he had appeared on the authorities' radar because of his work for the UK pharmaceutical giant.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey's ordeal also presaged a dramatic deterioration in China's human rights \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . His "confession" while under detention, which was broadcast by state television long before his trial, is now a common tactic employed in government prosecutions of Chinese human-rights lawyers, labour organisers and other activists. By Tom Mitchell in Beijing I N S I D E C H I N A'S P R I S O N SYS T E M According to the Ministry of Justice, under which the Bureau of Prison Administration operates, there are about 700 corrections facilities throughout China. The official reported rate of incarceration is 119 per 100,000, with 1,649,804 sentenced prisoners, but this statistic excludes pre-trial detainees and those held in administrative detention. A 2009 report from the deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate found that an additional 650,000 prisoners were held in detention centres throughout China.\par \par \uc2 Although the Chinese government officially states that its correctional institutions do not use torture as a method to extract information, a \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  report from 2015, quoted in a \uc2 US State Department\uc2  report, found "continued widespread use of degrading treatment and torture by law enforcement authorities" and revealed: "Some courts continued to admit coerced confessions as evidence, despite the criminal procedure law, which restricts the use of unlawfully obtained evidence."\par \par \uc2 The state department report went on to note "a lack of due process in judicial proceedings, political control of courts and judges, closed trials, the use of administrative detention, failure to protect refugees and asylum seekers, extrajudicial disappearances of citizens, restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), discrimination against women, minorities, and persons with disabilities". By Ian Trueger . block's wings. A bald middle-aged Malaysian lifer came to the gate and helped carry my prison bags. His nickname was MC. He was block eight's "king rat". He ran a Malaysian mafia that controlled all the food and job assignments at Qingpu.\par \par \uc2 "What are your thoughts?" a bespectacled senior officer asked me when I arrived. "I don't know what you mean," I replied. "What will you do here?" he asked. I did not realise his questions were euphemisms for, "Will you write the acknowledgment of guilt and 'repentance report'?" that was required of all prisoners. "I can teach some English to your staff," I said innocently. I was led to the "training cell" for new prisoners, and given blue-and-white-striped shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt with blue tabs, the summer prison uniform. I became prisoner number #42816.\par \par \uc2 My cell held 12 prisoners. We slept on iron bunks with wooden planks and a cotton "mattress" one-and-a-half inches thick, covered with a coarse striped sheet. The barred windows were never closed. Winter was freezing. "I am the cell leader," said a wiry young African, one of many Nigerians there, most convicted of drug smuggling and serving life terms.\par \par \uc2 We were joined by two Chinese prisoners who held foreign citizenship: Zhang, an Austrian citizen serving a long term for people-trafficking; and Chen, a Thai citizen who was in jail for embezzlement. They were snitches who informed against everybody and who had been moved into the cell to monitor me. As both spoke some English, they would follow me everywhere, listen to any conversations I had and report back to the officers. Zhang managed the cell block's factory production; Chen worked as "social secretary" between prisoners and officers. "How do sentence reductions work? How does the points system work?" I asked. "We don't know, you must ask the captains," they lied. "At least, if you want to qualify for reduction, you must confess."\par \par \uc2 I spoke next to a Captain Liu. "What are your thoughts?" he said in broken English in a small interview room with bars separating us. My first thought was, "Here we go again."\par \par \uc2 "I am innocent and I will not admit any crime," I said. "If I have to stay here, I will use my time to read. I can help teach people English if you want me to. I want to know about the sentence-reduction system."\par \par \uc2 Liu seemed awkward dealing with a grey-haired Englishman about his own age. "Studying is a privilege, not a right.\par \par \uc2 You should write confession and repentance reports," he said. He was more civilised than most warders and I think he genuinely hoped to have a good rapport with me. I disappointed him. "I will not write any of that," I said. "And I demand medical treatment for my ailments, including my prostate."\par \par \uc2 Zhang led me back to the cell. In the corridors and stairs other prisoners appeared. They smiled and nodded at me. On our corridor an African inmate tried to chat. "They told us all not to talk to you," he said. "They said you are an MI6 spy.\par \par \uc2 None of us believes it. We saw your trial on TV. We have been waiting for you. You are a hero. If you need anything, tell us, we will help you," he said, ignoring Zhang and Chen, who fluttered and clucked like anxious hens.\par \par \uc2 had brought no toiletries, having been told I would get new ones. Instead, I had to buy them and I had no prison account, even though my warders handed over the money from my detention centre account to the prison. The officers also banned me from sending letters to family, making phone calls or using the prison shopping system. But I soon found a pile of things on my bunk - tissues, laundry powder, biscuits, coffee sachets, a small towel, two plastic rice bowls, pens and notepaper. Inmates dropped these things there as anonymous charity donations.\par \par \uc2 Zhang and Chen led me to my first supper in the "workroom", where some 120 prisoners occupied rows of tables with backless, immovable seats attached. As I walked in, all eyes were on me, along with those of six officers. The food was warm here, sometimes hot. A standard dinner was a bowl of steamed rice, almost grit-free, stir-fry including a meat and a vegetable, and a thin soup. The Ritz! MC's gang served one cell at a time, ladling food from battered trays.\par \par \uc2 After a final roll-call at 9pm, the barred cell door was locked and trusted prisoners from a Chinese block stood watch on the corridor to report nefarious activity or suicide bids. The ceiling light was kept on all night. We awoke at 6am. One of us cleaned the toilet area before the others rose. A warder unlocked the cell and the men trooped down to the yard with Thermoses to collect boiled water for hot drinks or washing. Two flasks per man. For breakfast we ate plain rice congee or a steamed bun with salt pickles, and, every Sunday, a boiled egg. There was half-an-hour of exercise in the open air before breakfast in a yard the size of a basketball pitch.\par \par \uc2 After a few days, nice Captain Liu vanished and word flew round that young Captain Wei would manage our cell. Wei was notorious for persecuting inmates and stirring up incidents that led prisoners to get a beating and to be dragged offscreaming to solitary, which I witnessed over and over again. "They are sending him here because of you," I was told.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Wei summoned me several times a week for a "talk". He tried to provoke my anger, insulted me, ordered me to write confessions, threatened me with an extended sentence or solitary if I refused. I never yielded.\par \par \uc2 Every week I cited my medical problems and demanded proper examinations and treatment for my prostate. "But you haven't confessed," he would say. He staged searches and threw all my things out of my bunk drawers across the cell. He often removed my private diary, so I played cat and mouse, keeping my notebook on my person. I agreed to write a separate monthly "record of my progress" for him, but I only listed his abuses. He would write "good" on each page like a teacher. He obviously did not understand my handwritten English.\par \par \uc2 The prison was a business, doing manufacturing jobs for companies. Mornings, afternoons and often during the afterlunch nap, prisoners "laboured" in the common room. Our men made packaging parts. I recognised well-known brands - \uc2 3M\uc2 , \uc2 C&A\uc2 , \uc2 H&M\uc2 . So much for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , though the companies may well have been unaware that prison labour was part of their supply chain. Prisoners from Chinese cell blocks worked in our factory making textiles and components. They marched there like soldiers before our breakfast and returned late in the evening. The foreigners who laboured in my cell block were Africans and Asians with no money from family, and no other way to buy toiletries and snacks. It was piece work; a hundred of this, a thousand of that. Full-time, they earned about Rmb120 (\u163\'00\'A313.50) a month. But it was also about points. There was a sentence-reduction system based on points earned through labour - work such as floor cleaning, food serving, teaching and approved study. Snitching also earned favourable treatment.\par \par \uc2 Once or twice a year a list of prisoners went up showing who had earned reductions. Those on long terms crowded around, praying their name was on the board. Many were disappointed. Reductions had become rarer since President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  had taken power in early 2013. Before that, a 10-year term might be cut to seven. Under Xi you would be lucky to get one year taken off. I never qualified because I boycotted the thought reports. The officers refused to explain the system to me anyway.\par \par \uc2 ll ti etween bouts of persecution by Wei, I read books and newspapers sent by my Rotary Club community, and books from the prison "library" shelves managed by Stern Hu, a China-born Australian. Stern had led the China office of mining giant \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  before his arrest in 2009 on murky allegations of espionage and bribery, as China fought Australia over the price of iron ore. Ironically, I had commentated on his case on \uc2 CNN\uc2  at the time. Now I was his jailmate. Tall and aristocratic-looking, hair whitened by captivity, he was highly educated and very kind. He provided me with some of his warm clothing in winter and helped me with Chinese letter writing and reading. He was struggling with heart disease, and I worry about his health to this day.\par \par \uc2 Every encounter was an education. I had spent 15 years helping to prosecute fraudsters. Now, in prison, I met many people who might easily have been my investigation targets, but who I came to believe did not deserve such harsh sentences. I came away from my captivity with sympathy for both the innocent and the guilty.\par \par \uc2 I continued to refuse to "confess", and the captains continued to block my access to prostate treatment and warm clothing. Everybody was supposed to shave once or twice a week. Prisoners had their own razors, which were stored under lock and key. On certain days of the week the razors were handed out to their owners to shave and then handed back in immediately. I applied to have my family buy me a razor, but Wei kept blocking approval. They tried to make me use a shared razor. I refused on hygiene grounds. I grew a long straggly grey beard. Hair was cut every Saturday morning by prisoners. I let mine grow. Before long, I looked like a cross between Santa Claus and the Count of Monte Cristo. This drove Wei nuts. He tried to force me to shave, and I filed complaints to the prison and my consulate. Other prisoners started winking at me as I walked along the corridor and I noticed they had started to grow beards too.\par \par \uc2 My consular saviours - Roslyn, who took over from Usha, and Susie - brought letters and books from relatives and friends each month, and relayed my complaints to the prison and the authorities. One day, they brought me a copy of the United Nations treaties on imprisonment and torture that I had requested. These confirmed to me that China failed to comply with most of the standards of treatment (on nutrition, sleep, labour, health, contact with family, etc) required by international laws that China had signed, and I urged my consul to complain. I shared the treaties among the inmates. Handwritten copies proliferated. Some of the men started citing the treaties in complaints to the governor. The officers began to grow uneasy and I could sense that some wanted to get shot of me. Wei continued to threaten me with solitary and made efforts to ban me from sitting down anywhere.\par \par \uc2 In April 2015, something shifted. Consular lobbying and my relentless complaints forced the prison to send me for a PSA blood test and an MRI at a local hospital. Wei used the moment to parade me in front of the public at hospital in handcuffs and prison uniform. But the MRI result was a milestone. Within weeks, they had to admit that I had a tumour in my prostate, although they concealed the result of the blood test. The next step should have been a biopsy. Instead, they began to fake the paperwork for a sentence reduction for good behaviour.\par \par \uc2 It emerged from this that the real commander of cell block eight was one Captain Shang. He, and eventually the prison governor, spent long sessions pleading with me to sign an admission of guilt so that I could leave prison with Ying, whose sentence would expire on July 9 that year. "Even your wife could get a small reduction too," said Shang. He and I argued over the wording of a compromise statement that I would sign to satisfy the paperwork. He went back and forth to his superiors with my position. I finally signed a statement expressing qualified, conditional remorse if I had done anything wrong but not admitting that I had done anything wrong at all. Somehow they fudged it.\par \par \uc2 On June 4 2015, the prison smuggled me to the Shanghai Prison Hospital where I never saw a doctor but where they pretended I was getting medical attention for five days. The vice-governor came to me with a Gillette Turbo razor and begged me to use it. In my final act before leaving Qingpu, I shaved.\par \par \uc2 On June 9, they released Ying and me into house arrest in the Magnotel, a small hotel that sources said belonged to the security apparatus, pending our deportation. On June 17, the PSB men who had originally arrested and interrogated us in 2013 conveyed us to Pudong Airport to deport us on a Virgin flight to London. Just before we climbed aboard, the PSB handed us a bill for our nine-day stay in the Magnotel. We didn't have the cash with us, so we signed an "IOU".\par \par \uc2 P O S T S C R I P T After deportation to the UK in 2015, Peter Humphrey was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, and spent 18 months in cancer treatment and one year in PTSD treatment. He fought a 21-month legal battle against the Home Office over Yu's right to stay in the UK and won in court. He filed a detailed report to the Beijing government on Shanghai's abuse of China's judicial system and awaits a reaction. He and his wife have filed suit against GSK in US courts on racketeering charges. His damaged health has prevented his return to business and he has reverted to his journalistic and academic roots as a sinologist and writer. He was banned from China for 10 years but does not rule out a return when conditions are favourable.\par \par \uc2 Peter Humphrey: my time in a Chinese prison A personal account of 23 months spent in captivity.ft.com/humphrey V I D E O\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b CO\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 glxo : \uc2 GlaxoSmithKline PLC\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 i257 : \uc2 Pharmaceuticals | i951 : \uc2 Health Care/Life Sciences\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 gfinc : \uc2 Financial Crime | gpris : \uc2 Prisons/Prisoners | gfraud : \uc2 Fraud | c12 : \uc2 Corporate Crime/Legal Action | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | gcat : \uc2 Political/General News | gcns : \uc2 National/Public Security | gcrim : \uc2 Crime/Legal Action | ghome : \uc2 Law Enforcement | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfcpex : \uc2 C&E Executive News Filter | nfcpin : \uc2 C&E Industry News Filter\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 china : \uc2 China | uk : \uc2 United Kingdom | apacz : \uc2 Asia Pacific | asiaz : \uc2 Asia | bric : \uc2 BRICS Countries | chinaz : \uc2 Greater China | devgcoz : \uc2 Emerging Market Countries | dvpcoz : \uc2 Developing Economies | easiaz : \uc2 Eastern Asia | eecz : \uc2 European Union Countries | eurz : \uc2 Europe | weurz : \uc2 Western Europe\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 The Financial Times Limited (AAIW/EIW)\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document FTFT000020180217ee2h0006f\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw122\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1830\pichgoal600

Two months later, it also received a secretly filmed sex tape featuring GSK's China chief Mark Reilly. The company hired ChinaWhys, a risk-advisory firm based in Shanghai, to investigate Vivian Shi, its former head of government affairs, suspecting her at that time of a smear campaign. ChinaWhys was run by Briton Peter Humphrey, a former journalist who had previously led China investigations for US risk consultancy Kroll and the accounting firm PwC, and his Chinese-born American wife Yu Yingzeng. Both were certified fraud investigators.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 In June 2013, the Chinese government announced a bribery investigation into GSK China. In July, Humphrey and Yu were detained and charged with "illegally acquiring personal information" of Chinese nationals. The story received huge attention internationally and, in August 2013, the couple were paraded on state TV, purportedly confessing.\par \par \uc2 In a note dictated from prison in March 2014 and seen by the FT, Humphrey accused GSK of having failed to fully disclose the corruption allegations against the company when he agreed to work for them.\par \par \uc2 In August 2014, he and Yu finally stood trial and were convicted and sentenced to 30 and 24 months in jail respectively. In a separate trial in September 2014, GSK China was found guilty of bribery and paid a fine of \u163\'00\'A3297m, upon which its detained executives were released.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey was released from prison under diplomatic pressure in June 2015 amid reports of ill health, and he and Yu left the country. This is his first personal account of the 23 months they spent in captivity. .\par \par \uc2 I sat on the rough wooden floorboards of artan cell in the Shanghai Detention re, reading an old copy of FT Weekend had been brought in by my consul, shivering as winter approached. ot the kind of spot the FT imagines its ers in. But in 2013, this floor - shared 2 prisoners - was my breakfast, lunch dinner table. I was reading an interview Russia's most famous convict, oligarch hail Khodorkovsky, who was stuck inside t was a powerful article, which aroused wn ordeal and spurred me to read more widely about captivity. During the 23 months I spent imprisoned in China, on false charges that were never proven in court, I consumed about 140 books, including jailbird classics such as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Dumas' Man in the Iron Mask, Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, and modern equivalents such as Marina Nemat's Prisoner of Tehran. Mental fodder to help me endure my own predicament.\par \par \uc2 This "detention centre" was once one of China's notorious - and supposedly now abolished - "education through labour" prisons for miscreants in the Communist partyruled dictatorship. Today, they pretend to be custody centres but they are still punishment centres. Untried prisoners are condemned from day one, starting with the dire conditions they face when they arrive. The aim is to isolate, crush the spirit, break the will. Many crumble quickly.\par \par \uc2 My journey here began at the offices of my corporate investigation company in Shanghai on July 10 2013. I had living quarters there with my wife, Ying, and we were getting ready for our day. At 7am the Public Security Bureau (PSB) police flooded in, kicking our bedroom door into my face and injuring my neck. From that moment on, things moved ruthlessly fast: they ransacked the office, dismissed my staff, separated my wife and me from each other, and both of us from our teenage son Harvey. It would be two years before we were reunited.\par \par \uc2 Men in plain clothes drove us in unmarked black cars into the bowels of a hulking concrete building known as "803", a feared headquarters of the Shanghai PSB. I was taken along underground corridors lined by dank interrogation cells, and through the gaps in doors saw prisoners slumped in metal chairs. When we reached my room, I sat in an interrogation chair with a lockable crossbar. PSB men came and went, asking questions about items found on our laptops. On a podium my confiscated mobile phone rang relentlessly but our son's frantic calls to us went unanswered.\par \par \uc2 "Where did you get this?" "Where did you get that?" The interrogators' questions were targeted. They knew what they wanted. As a business specialising in investigative work, we used code names. "Who's this agent? And his phone number?" Fifteen hours later, we sped out of the building in the dead of night. Ying and I were again in separate black cars. There was no word on where we were going. As we rode into a slum offthe Hunan Road, a PSB man handcuffed me, saying, "I'm sorry, I don't think you deserve this but I have orders from above."\par \par \uc2 We halted in a dark alley before a towering gatehouse with one-foot-thick iron doors rolling into the walls on either side. The gates were guarded by paramilitaries of the People's Armed Police (PAP). Other PAP men patrolled the two-metrethick perimeter walls. In a "check-in" area, our pockets were emptied. I had to take offmy jacket, shirt, slacks and Pierre Cardin shoes, and was photographed against a wall, front and side on. Ying and I were taken to separate floors of the cell block. A warder made me strip to check I wasn't hiding anything - anywhere. He threw me some cotton shoes half my size and a smelly red vest with a "V" torn into its neck, and "Shanghai Detention Centre" stamped on its back.\par \par \uc2 At about 3am I was tossed into a sweltering cell. It was, I learnt, a ritual - new prisoners were always delivered at night. It reinforced the shock. Made them weaker. Easier to break, to extract confessions from. The warder shut the door with a clang and uncuffed me through the bars. "What's up?" mumbled a sleepy voice in Chinese from under a mound of pink bedclothes. "A new guy," said another. A man in boxer shorts came to the door. "Sleep there," he said, dumping a dirty quilt on a narrow spot beside the toilet.\par \par \uc2 My head was bursting hot. Stunned and exhausted, I wept. Around the cell, shaved heads popped up like chicks from a nest to glimpse the commotion, then went back to sleep nonchalantly. A dozen or so bodies lay in rows on the rough boards, like sardines in cans with pink lids. A ceiling light burned brightly - in fact, it was never off. I felt winded. How could I sleep? Then suddenly it was light outside too. It must have crept up slowly but the new day came as a shock. My horror movie rolled to the next scene.\par \par \uc2 A low-pitched horn broke the silence. I hear it every day still. Bodies sat up. Warders on the corridor in pale-blue shirts banged on the bars. "Qilai, qilai." "Get up!" At breakfast the gritty rice and the briny smell of pickle made me retch. Some men had sachets of "cereal" powder that they mixed with boiled water from an urn perched outside the bars. "Have one of my cereals," said one inmate. Two men cleared the dishes and took them to the sink. Their actions were chores rostered to each detainee by the warder. Cleaning the floor, washing the dishes, scrubbing the toilet, stacking the boxes and quilts, emptying the urn twice a day for refilling, washing and folding the cloths. These jobs rotated each week.\par \par \uc2 The men exercised by circling the cell for 10 minutes like Tibetan pilgrims at a temple, minus the Buddhist chants. But this was no temple, just a floor five by three metres. The entrance and toilet added another two square metres. The toilet was a hole in the floor with a rusty flushing lever on the wall behind it. The sink was a heavy, cracked ceramic affair with a cold tap. Above it was a piece of shiny plastic, supposedly a mirror, warped so you couldn't see a clear image. During 14 months here, I did not see my own face.\par \par \uc2 After the "stroll" came the toilet ritual. Orange vests sat on designated spots beside the wall. Red vests - new boys - faced the grille studying a brown rule book. We went to the toilet in turns, red vests last. Squatting over the hole I almost toppled as I reached for the flusher behind me. "To shit, face forward; to piss, face the wall," barked Li, the cell boss. "That way, it falls the right way without a mess. You did it the wrong way." Over the next 10 days, like a dog yapping at my ankles, Li ordered me to do this and do that. To learn the rules.\par \par \uc2 Some of the men were kind; not all. On day 10, the warder ordered me to gather my things. "You are going home," said Li. The other men echoed his pronouncement and told me to put on proper clothes and dump my red vest. My heart rose. When the warder fetched me, he barked at Li, who had cruelly conned me - I was only moving cell. My heart sank.\par \par \uc2 They moved me to Cell 203 and gave me an orange vest.\par \par \uc2 My new boss was Liu, 34, sentenced to 13 years for illegally owning guns to shoot rabbits. "Most people here committed crimes for money," said Liu. "But I am only here because of my hobby." There were three Chinese in their late fifties like me, in the green vests worn by inmates with chronic illnesses. All three were wealthy businessmen, hostile to the political system. All were awaiting trial, accused of fraud; all claimed to have been framed. The cell was nicknamed "sick men's cell" by the others; I called it "the billionaires' cell".\par \par \uc2 Whatever the cell, the rituals were the same. During exercises, which were aired on a closed-circuit overhead TV, imitated jumps and stretches performed by three PE coaches, one male, two female - the closest my cellmates ever got to a .\par \par \uc2 . woman. Then a white-coated patrol doctor came by our grille. Inmates raised health issues but they would be lucky to get a dollop of ointment for a sore foot, or an aspirin.\par \par \uc2 Next came "study time". We sat cross-legged on red spots on the floor while the TV relayed "lessons" from the detention centre "propaganda department". Sometimes it was the "propaganda director" preaching about good behaviour and analysing recent statistics: how many detainees had quarrelled or fought; how many inmates had argued with the guards or broken other rules, and been punished by isolation or prolonged squatting. Inmates sat quietly. Some would try sneak-reading a book. Others plotted how to handle their case, or dreamed. Nobody took "study" seriously, though sometimes we had to write a commentary on the session.\par \par \uc2 That was our life. A waiting game. No family visits.\par \par \uc2 No letters home. Just brief messages to lawyers. No chance to orchestrate a real defence. Foreign prisoners could receive consular visits, to the envy of Chinese cellmates. Usha, the vice-consul who visited me regularly, and her assistant Susie, relayed messages to and from my family, brought books and magazines, and lobbied over my health. They were my angels. In the detention centre I developed symptoms of prostate cancer, a long hernia, skin rashes, anal infections and constant diarrhoea, and endured an injury to my spine inflicted during the raid. None was treated.\par \par \uc2 There were frequent interrogations. For these I was locked in an iron chair inside a steel cage facing a podium where three PSB men questioned me and, once or twice, men from "a different department". Most of it was smoke. I had to thumbprint statements in red seal ink, and specimen documents from my project files. The PSB men did not want to hear any mitigating explanations. They tried to make it look as though Ying and I earned millions from trading in data, which we never did. Twice, the "other department" men tried to stitch me up for spying. They tried to accuse me of spying in the restive Muslim region of Xinjiang. They tried to tie me to a US intelligence entity spying on North Korea.\par \par \uc2 After seven months, Ying and I were finally allowed to exchange jailbird love letters. They took a month to travel 30 metres through the concrete and three layers of police censorship. We were not allowed to discuss our case. Some of our letters were blocked without telling us. But I reminded myself that the Chinese men had no such privilege.\par \par \uc2 After 13 months without trial, I finally went to court on August 8 2014, where Ying and I were charged with "illegally acquiring citizens' information" (which we denied). That day also saw one of the most deeply distressing moments of the entire ordeal. The police had told me shortly before our trial that Ying had been informed of the recent death of her brother, Bernard. So, on the morning of our trial, when I saw her on the stairs in the courthouse, I expressed my condolences. The manner in which she broke down told me instantly that they had lied. She didn't know. I believe they did this on purpose to destabilise us for the trial. We were predictably sent down, me for 30 months and Ying for 24.\par \par \uc2 From the moon, Qingpu Prison would look like a peaceful walled university campus with dorms, gardens, camphor trees, a soccer pitch and a parade ground. From my level, there were a dozen concrete cell blocks with barred windows, a prison theatre, an office block, a kitchen, a boiler house and a factory. The perimeter wall bristled with razor wire and was patrolled by armed PAP guards. It could hold 5,000-6,000 prisoners. It also "trained" prisoners for redistribution to other prisons.\par \par \uc2 Cell block eight was for foreign men, the adjacent block for Chinese. A tall iron fence sealed offa yard between the .\par \par \uc2 When Peter Humphrey was arrested by Chinese police in July 2013, the world still knew very little about China's new president and Communist party general secretary, \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It seems naive now, but five years ago many people hoped Xi's administration would press ahead with difficult economic and perhaps even political reforms. The cases brought against Humphrey, his wife Yu Yingzeng and their corporate client GSK were some of the first indications that the international business community was about to enter uncharted territory as Xi quickly established himself as China's most powerful leader in decades.\par \par \uc2 GSK was one of the first corporate casualties of Xi's anti-corruption campaign, which has been unprecedented in scope. Shanghai police charged the UK company's staffwith paying doctors hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey, a former Reuters reporter turned private investigator, was charged with illegally obtaining private information. His case was never officially connected to the GSK investigation, but few people doubted that he had appeared on the authorities' radar because of his work for the UK pharmaceutical giant.\par \par \uc2 Humphrey's ordeal also presaged a dramatic deterioration in China's human rights \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2 . His "confession" while under detention, which was broadcast by state television long before his trial, is now a common tactic employed in government prosecutions of Chinese human-rights lawyers, labour organisers and other activists. By Tom Mitchell in Beijing\par \par \uc2 INSIDE CHINA'S PRISON SYSTEM\par \par \uc2 According to the Ministry of Justice, under which the Bureau of Prison Administration operates, there are about 700 corrections facilities throughout China. The official reported rate of incarceration is 119 per 100,000, with 1,649,804 sentenced prisoners, but this statistic excludes pre-trial detainees and those held in administrative detention. A 2009 report from the deputy procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate found that an additional 650,000 prisoners were held in detention centres throughout China.\par \par \uc2 Although the Chinese government officially states that its correctional institutions do not use torture as a method to extract information, a \uc2 Human Rights Watch\uc2  report from 2015, quoted in a \uc2 US State Department\uc2  report, found "continued widespread use of degrading treatment and torture by law enforcement authorities" and revealed: "Some courts continued to admit coerced confessions as evidence, despite the criminal procedure law, which restricts the use of unlawfully obtained evidence."\par \par \uc2 The state department report went on to note "a lack of due process in judicial proceedings, political control of courts and judges, closed trials, the use of administrative detention, failure to protect refugees and asylum seekers, extrajudicial disappearances of citizens, restrictions on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), discrimination against women, minorities, and persons with disabilities". By Ian Trueger . block's wings. A bald middle-aged Malaysian lifer came to the gate and helped carry my prison bags. His nickname was MC. He was block eight's "king rat". He ran a Malaysian mafia that controlled all the food and job assignments at Qingpu.\par \par \uc2 "What are your thoughts?" a bespectacled senior officer asked me when I arrived. "I don't know what you mean," I replied. "What will you do here?" he asked. I did not realise his questions were euphemisms for, "Will you write the acknowledgment of guilt and 'repentance report'?" that was required of all prisoners. "I can teach some English to your staff," I said innocently. I was led to the "training cell" for new prisoners, and given blue-and-white-striped shorts and a white short-sleeved shirt with blue tabs, the summer prison uniform. I became prisoner number #42816.\par \par \uc2 My cell held 12 prisoners. We slept on iron bunks with wooden planks and a cotton "mattress" one-and-a-half inches thick, covered with a coarse striped sheet. The barred windows were never closed. Winter was freezing. "I am the cell leader," said a wiry young African, one of many Nigerians there, most convicted of drug smuggling and serving life terms.\par \par \uc2 We were joined by two Chinese prisoners who held foreign citizenship: Zhang, an Austrian citizen serving a long term for people-trafficking; and Chen, a Thai citizen who was in jail for embezzlement. They were snitches who informed against everybody and who had been moved into the cell to monitor me. As both spoke some English, they would follow me everywhere, listen to any conversations I had and report back to the officers. Zhang managed the cell block's factory production; Chen worked as "social secretary" between prisoners and officers. "How do sentence reductions work? How does the points system work?" I asked. "We don't know, you must ask the captains," they lied. "At least, if you want to qualify for reduction, you must confess."\par \par \uc2 I spoke next to a Captain Liu. "What are your thoughts?" he said in broken English in a small interview room with bars separating us. My first thought was, "Here we go again."\par \par \uc2 "I am innocent and I will not admit any crime," I said. "If I have to stay here, I will use my time to read. I can help teach people English if you want me to. I want to know about the sentence-reduction system."\par \par \uc2 Liu seemed awkward dealing with a grey-haired Englishman about his own age. "Studying is a privilege, not a right.\par \par \uc2 You should write confession and repentance reports," he said. He was more civilised than most warders and I think he genuinely hoped to have a good rapport with me. I disappointed him. "I will not write any of that," I said. "And I demand medical treatment for my ailments, including my prostate."\par \par \uc2 Zhang led me back to the cell. In the corridors and stairs other prisoners appeared. They smiled and nodded at me. On our corridor an African inmate tried to chat. "They told us all not to talk to you," he said. "They said you are an MI6 spy.\par \par \uc2 None of us believes it. We saw your trial on TV. We have been waiting for you. You are a hero. If you need anything, tell us, we will help you," he said, ignoring Zhang and Chen, who fluttered and clucked like anxious hens.\par \par \uc2 had brought no toiletries, having been told I would get new ones. Instead, I had to buy them and I had no prison account, even though my warders handed over the money from my detention centre account to the prison. The officers also banned me from sending letters to family, making phone calls or using the prison shopping system. But I soon found a pile of things on my bunk - tissues, laundry powder, biscuits, coffee sachets, a small towel, two plastic rice bowls, pens and notepaper. Inmates dropped these things there as anonymous charity donations.\par \par \uc2 Zhang and Chen led me to my first supper in the "workroom", where some 120 prisoners occupied rows of tables with backless, immovable seats attached. As I walked in, all eyes were on me, along with those of six officers. The food was warm here, sometimes hot. A standard dinner was a bowl of steamed rice, almost grit-free, stir-fry including a meat and a vegetable, and a thin soup. The Ritz! MC's gang served one cell at a time, ladling food from battered trays.\par \par \uc2 After a final roll-call at 9pm, the barred cell door was locked and trusted prisoners from a Chinese block stood watch on the corridor to report nefarious activity or suicide bids. The ceiling light was kept on all night. We awoke at 6am. One of us cleaned the toilet area before the others rose. A warder unlocked the cell and the men trooped down to the yard with Thermoses to collect boiled water for hot drinks or washing. Two flasks per man. For breakfast we ate plain rice congee or a steamed bun with salt pickles, and, every Sunday, a boiled egg. There was half-an-hour of exercise in the open air before breakfast in a yard the size of a basketball pitch.\par \par \uc2 After a few days, nice Captain Liu vanished and word flew round that young Captain Wei would manage our cell. Wei was notorious for persecuting inmates and stirring up incidents that led prisoners to get a beating and to be dragged offscreaming to solitary, which I witnessed over and over again. "They are sending him here because of you," I was told.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, Wei summoned me several times a week for a "talk". He tried to provoke my anger, insulted me, ordered me to write confessions, threatened me with an extended sentence or solitary if I refused. I never yielded.\par \par \uc2 Every week I cited my medical problems and demanded proper examinations and treatment for my prostate. "But you haven't confessed," he would say. He staged searches and threw all my things out of my bunk drawers across the cell. He often removed my private diary, so I played cat and mouse, keeping my notebook on my person. I agreed to write a separate monthly "record of my progress" for him, but I only listed his abuses. He would write "good" on each page like a teacher. He obviously did not understand my handwritten English.\par \par \uc2 The prison was a business, doing manufacturing jobs for companies. Mornings, afternoons and often during the afterlunch nap, prisoners "laboured" in the common room. Our men made packaging parts. I recognised well-known brands - \uc2 3M\uc2 , \uc2 C&A\uc2 , \uc2 H&M\uc2 . So much for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , though the companies may well have been unaware that prison labour was part of their supply chain. Prisoners from Chinese cell blocks worked in our factory making textiles and components. They marched there like soldiers before our breakfast and returned late in the evening. The foreigners who laboured in my cell block were Africans and Asians with no money from family, and no other way to buy toiletries and snacks. It was piece work; a hundred of this, a thousand of that. Full-time, they earned about Rmb120 (\u163\'00\'A313.50) a month. But it was also about points. There was a sentence-reduction system based on points earned through labour - work such as floor cleaning, food serving, teaching and approved study. Snitching also earned favourable treatment.\par \par \uc2 Once or twice a year a list of prisoners went up showing who had earned reductions. Those on long terms crowded around, praying their name was on the board. Many were disappointed. Reductions had become rarer since President \uc2 Xi Jinping\uc2  had taken power in early 2013. Before that, a 10-year term might be cut to seven. Under Xi you would be lucky to get one year taken off. I never qualified because I boycotted the thought reports. The officers refused to explain the system to me anyway.\par \par \uc2 ll ti etween bouts of persecution by Wei, I read books and newspapers sent by my Rotary Club community, and books from the prison "library" shelves managed by Stern Hu, a China-born Australian. Stern had led the China office of mining giant \uc2 Rio Tinto\uc2  before his arrest in 2009 on murky allegations of espionage and bribery, as China fought Australia over the price of iron ore. Ironically, I had commentated on his case on \uc2 CNN\uc2  at the time. Now I was his jailmate. Tall and aristocratic-looking, hair whitened by captivity, he was highly educated and very kind. He provided me with some of his warm clothing in winter and helped me with Chinese letter writing and reading. He was struggling with heart disease, and I worry about his health to this day.\par \par \uc2 Every encounter was an education. I had spent 15 years helping to prosecute fraudsters. Now, in prison, I met many people who might easily have been my investigation targets, but who I came to believe did not deserve such harsh sentences. I came away from my captivity with sympathy for both the innocent and the guilty.\par \par \uc2 I continued to refuse to "confess", and the captains continued to block my access to prostate treatment and warm clothing. Everybody was supposed to shave once or twice a week. Prisoners had their own razors, which were stored under lock and key. On certain days of the week the razors were handed out to their owners to shave and then handed back in immediately. I applied to have my family buy me a razor, but Wei kept blocking approval. They tried to make me use a shared razor. I refused on hygiene grounds. I grew a long straggly grey beard. Hair was cut every Saturday morning by prisoners. I let mine grow. Before long, I looked like a cross between Santa Claus and the Count of Monte Cristo. This drove Wei nuts. He tried to force me to shave, and I filed complaints to the prison and my consulate. Other prisoners started winking at me as I walked along the corridor and I noticed they had started to grow beards too.\par \par \uc2 My consular saviours - Roslyn, who took over from Usha, and Susie - brought letters and books from relatives and friends each month, and relayed my complaints to the prison and the authorities. One day, they brought me a copy of the United Nations treaties on imprisonment and torture that I had requested. These confirmed to me that China failed to comply with most of the standards of treatment (on nutrition, sleep, labour, health, contact with family, etc) required by international laws that China had signed, and I urged my consul to complain. I shared the treaties among the inmates. Handwritten copies proliferated. Some of the men started citing the treaties in complaints to the governor. The officers began to grow uneasy and I could sense that some wanted to get shot of me. Wei continued to threaten me with solitary and made efforts to ban me from sitting down anywhere.\par \par \uc2 In April 2015, something shifted. Consular lobbying and my relentless complaints forced the prison to send me for a PSA blood test and an MRI at a local hospital. Wei used the moment to parade me in front of the public at hospital in handcuffs and prison uniform. But the MRI result was a milestone. Within weeks, they had to admit that I had a tumour in my prostate, although they concealed the result of the blood test. The next step should have been a biopsy. Instead, they began to fake the paperwork for a sentence reduction for good behaviour.\par \par \uc2 It emerged from this that the real commander of cell block eight was one Captain Shang. He, and eventually the prison governor, spent long sessions pleading with me to sign an admission of guilt so that I could leave prison with Ying, whose sentence would expire on July 9 that year. "Even your wife could get a small reduction too," said Shang. He and I argued over the wording of a compromise statement that I would sign to satisfy the paperwork. He went back and forth to his superiors with my position. I finally signed a statement expressing qualified, conditional remorse if I had done anything wrong but not admitting that I had done anything wrong at all. Somehow they fudged it.\par \par \uc2 On June 4 2015, the prison smuggled me to the Shanghai Prison Hospital where I never saw a doctor but where they pretended I was getting medical attention for five days. The vice-governor came to me with a Gillette Turbo razor and begged me to use it. In my final act before leaving Qingpu, I shaved.\par \par \uc2 On June 9, they released Ying and me into house arrest in the Magnotel, a small hotel that sources said belonged to the security apparatus, pending our deportation. On June 17, the PSB men who had originally arrested and interrogated us in 2013 conveyed us to Pudong Airport to deport us on a Virgin flight to London. Just before we climbed aboard, the PSB handed us a bill for our nine-day stay in the Magnotel. We didn't have the cash with us, so we signed an "IOU".\par \par \uc2 POSTS CRIPT\par \par \uc2 After deportation to the UK in 2015, Peter Humphrey was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer, and spent 18 months in cancer treatment and one year in PTSD treatment. He fought a 21-month legal battle against the Home Office over Yu's right to stay in the UK and won in court. He filed a detailed report to the Beijing government on Shanghai's abuse of China's judicial system and awaits a reaction. He and his wife have filed suit against GSK in US courts on racketeering charges. His damaged health has prevented his return to business and he has reverted to his journalistic and academic roots as a sinologist and writer.

What does hockey have to do with environmental policy? Well, for one thing, the game is played on ice. And frozen ponds, where so many of the league's players learned to skate, are in trouble. The average length of the skating season may shrink by one-third in eastern Canada and by 20% in western Canada in coming decades.\par \par \uc2 That's according to research in the \uc2 NHL\uc2 's 2018 sustainability report, out Wednesday morning. The report assesses the league's own environmental impact and its commitment to fighting climate change.\par \par \uc2 Allen Hershkowitz, founding director and chairman of the Board of Sport and Sustainability International, credits the \uc2 NHL\uc2  for using that term -- "climate change" -- after the Trump administration announced in June that the U.S. would walk away from the 195-nation Paris climate accord and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said carbon dioxide is not a primary contributor to global warming.\par \par \uc2 "It would be dishonest not to acknowledge that the report is coming out when the world is facing the most challenging political climate in the United States as it relates to climate change policies," says Hershkowitz, whose non-governmental organization has members in more than 50 countries.\par \par \uc2 Leagues prefer to stay far away from controversy so they don't alienate fans. Just look at the \uc2 NFL\uc2 , where players kneeling for the national anthem last season caused considerable outcry.\par \par \uc2 Hershkowitz says climate change is about science, not politics. Even so, does the \uc2 NHL\uc2  worry about disaffecting fans who may think otherwise?\par \par \uc2 "What I would say is, when we do this work, we try to do it as apolitically as possible," says Omar Mitchell, NHL vice president for \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 . "Because at the end of the day, as our commissioner would say, this is the right thing to do."\par \par \uc2 More than a dozen federal agencies issued a report late last year that said humans are the dominant cause of a rise in global temperatures that has led to the warmest period in the history of civilization. That report said global average temperatures have increased 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 115 years.\par \par \uc2 That's a period of time that encompasses the rise of hockey. The \uc2 NHL\uc2  celebrated its centennial in 2017 -- and it wants to be around for its bicentennial.\par \par \uc2 "How we think about our \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and how we think about sustainability is going to be a critical element in making sure our sport has a future," says Kim Davis, NHL executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NHL\uc2 's report is voluntary. "And what gives the report its teeth is that we did a carbon inventory" of the league's own environmental impact, Mitchell says. "Hockey is a very energy-intensive sport. Our analysis shows about 66% of our carbon footprint is attributed to energy usage to create an ice sheet. So what we are trying to do is to promote innovations that will lower energy consumption within our buildings."\par \par \uc2 The league launched its \uc2 NHL\uc2  Green initiative in 2010 and released its first sustainability report in 2014. Among highlights of this second report:\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NHL\uc2  reduced energy consumption 1% from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NHL\uc2  decreased water consumption 7% from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 NHL\uc2  reduced CO2 emissions by 2% year-over-year from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016.\par \par \uc2 "The single most important thing the \uc2 NHL\uc2  has done is measure, and refine the measurement protocol, for professional sports," Hershkowitz says. "It can't be understated how important that is, (measuring) energy use, water use and waste generation at arenas that you don't own and that you occupy for only a fraction of the time."\par \par \uc2 Scott Jenkins is general manager of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta and chairman of the Green Sports Alliance, which includes nearly 500 sports teams and venues from 15 sports leagues in 14 countries. He says sports teams are in favorable positions to influence the broader culture on environmental concerns and to show that being environmentally sensitive is good for business.\par \par \uc2 "We can't afford to live on the sidelines," Jenkins says. "We have to get in the game."\par \par \uc2 Which brings us back to frozen ponds. The \uc2 NHL\uc2 's sustainability report tells of RinkWatch, which encourages citizens to monitor outdoor rinks and ponds in their neighborhoods. The initiative was launched by researchers at \uc2 Wilfrid Laurier University\uc2  in Waterloo, Ontario, in 2013. More than 1,400 rinks and ponds are tracked to help scientists study the long-term effects of climate change.\par \par \uc2 "If you trace (hockey) back to the sort of humble beginnings, particularly in Canada, it all goes back to frozen ponds," Davis says. "A lot of NHL players grew up playing hockey outdoors. It's such a critical part of the game, and it's important that access remains available for future generations."\par \par \uc2 CREDIT: Erik Brady, \uc2 USA TODAY\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b NS\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 giceh : \uc2 Ice Hockey | gclimt : \uc2 Climate Change | gsporg : \uc2 Sports Organizations | c151 : \uc2 Earnings | e1105 : \uc2 Consumer Sentiment | ecat : \uc2 Economic News | genv : \uc2 Natural Environment | ghock : \uc2 Field Hockey | gsust : \uc2 Sustainable Development | gwere : \uc2 Routine Weather Reports | npag : \uc2 Page-One Stories | c15 : \uc2 Financial Performance | ccat : \uc2 Corporate/Industrial News | e11 : \uc2 Economic Performance/Indicators | gcat : \uc2 Political/General News | gglobe : \uc2 Global/World Issues | gspo : \uc2 Sports | gwea : \uc2 Weather | gwint : \uc2 Winter Sports | ncat : \uc2 Content Types | nfact : \uc2 Factiva Filters | nfce : \uc2 C&E Exclusion Filter | nfcpin : \uc2 C&E Industry News Filter | nrgn : \uc2 Routine General News\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b RE\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 cana : \uc2 Canada | namz : \uc2 North America\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b IPD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Newspapers | USA Today, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc. | News\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b PUB\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 USA Today Information Network\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b AN\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Document USAT000020180328ee3s0000f\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row}\pard \ql \li-720\ri-720\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin-720\lin-720\itap0 }{\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Beinecke and his wife, Betty, moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1979, they were shocked by the dilapidated state of Central Park. Far from the emerald jewel that Mr. Beinecke recalled from childhood visits to his grandparents\u8217\'20\'19 New York apartment, the park had become strewn with litter, its buildings covered with graffiti, its gardens full of weeds and its benches broken and rusting.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt bothered us to see the park in such a state of disrepair and decay,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Beinecke wrote in a memoir years later, \u8220\'20\'1Cbut we weren\u8217\'20\'19t sure what to do about it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 They didn\u8217\'20\'19t wait long to find out. In the spring of 1980, the Beineckes stopped by the city\u8217\'20\'19s Parks Department to ask how they could help. Unbeknown to them, the parks commissioner at the time, Gordon J. Davis, and a colleague were establishing a partnership to support the park. They had the support of Mayor Edward I. Koch but had struck out recruiting a chairman who could tap into the city\u8217\'20\'19s business community. Mr. Beinecke, newly retired from a successful corporate career, was the ideal candidate.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CHe literally just walked in the door,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Davis recalled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke (pronounced BINE-eh-key) agreed to serve as the first chairman of what became the Central Park Conservancy, and quickly recruited to the board many of the same corporate leaders who had previously turned Mr. Davis down. The conservancy is widely credited with helping to revitalize the park, and has served as a model for similar public-private partnerships across the country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 103.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke lived in New Jersey for much of his life \u8212\'20\'14 he grew up in Cranford and raised his family in Summit \u8212\'20\'14 but he had a lifelong connection to New York. His paternal grandfather, Bernhard Beinecke, was a German immigrant and entrepreneur who built the Plaza Hotel, at the southeast corner of Central Park. Mr. Beinecke wrote that one of his earliest memories was of watching from his family\u8217\'20\'19s 12th-floor suite at the Plaza as returning veterans from World War I paraded up Fifth Avenue.\par \par \uc2 His professional life likewise had a family connection. Mr. Beinecke spent his career at the \uc2 Sperry & Hutchinson Company\uc2 , which his maternal grandfather, William Sperry Miller, founded with a partner in 1896. The company became well-known for its Green Stamps, which customers earned by shopping at participating gasoline stations and grocery stores and could trade in for rewards.\par \par \uc2 S & H, as the company was known, benefited greatly from the rise of the suburban middle class after World War II. Mr. Beinecke, who served as the company\u8217\'20\'19s chairman and chief executive in the 1960s and \u8242\'20\'3270s, took the company public in 1966 and diversified its holdings into furniture and other businesses.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke saw his business and philanthropic endeavors as sharing a common purpose, and embraced the idea of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  long before that phrase became fashionable. That impulse led him to wage a decades-long campaign to persuade \uc2 Yale University\uc2  to create a business school, which he saw as a way for the university to engage with \u8212\'20\'14 and help shape \u8212\'20\'14 the rise of corporations as a force in American civic life.\par \par \uc2 The proposal initially faced opposition from some at the university, who saw it as a distraction from Yale\u8217\'20\'19s core liberal arts mission. But Mr. Beinecke and his allies eventually prevailed, and the Yale School of Management opened in 1976, with the Beineckes as major benefactors.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIn my 30-odd years in business, few things have surprised and disappointed me more than the attitude many businessmen have about the world beyond their business and their careers,\u8221\'20\'1D Mr. Beinecke said in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://som.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Birth%20of%20the%20School_1.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 speech in 1983}}}\uc2  commemorating the founding of the school. \u8220\'20\'1CEven men of the highest capacity will, without regret, limit themselves to a two-course curriculum \u8212\'20\'14 they major in bottom-line and minor in golf.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 William Sperry Beinecke was born on May 22, 1914, in New York City, to Frederick W. Beinecke and the former Carrie Sperry.\par \par \uc2 After earning his bachelor\u8217\'20\'19s degree, in economics, from Yale and a law degree from \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 , he joined the Navy as the United States was preparing to enter World War II. He went on to serve on destroyers in the Atlantic and Pacific, and left the Navy as a lieutenant commander.\par \par \uc2 Weeks before he was called to active duty in 1941, Mr. Beinecke married the former Elizabeth Gillespie. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=126239159"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 She died in 2009.}}}\uc2  Mr. Beinecke is survived by two sons, Frederick and John; two daughters, Frances Beinecke and Sarah Beinecke Richardson; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 When he returned from the war, Mr. Beinecke briefly practiced law before joining \uc2 Sperry & Hutchinson\uc2  as general counsel in 1951. At S & H, he helped fight efforts in several states to restrict or ban Green Stamps and similar rewards programs as anticompetitive.\par \par \uc2 He retired in 1980 and embarked on what amounted to a second career in philanthropy. Besides his work for Central Park and Yale, where Mr. Beinecke was a trustee, he was the founding chairman of the \uc2 Hudson River Foundation\uc2  and served on the boards of the New York Botanical Garden and the \uc2 American Museum of Natural History\uc2 . The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://prospect-hill.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Prospect Hill Foundation}}}\uc2 , which Mr. and Mrs. Beinecke created in 1959, has supported programs in the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and nuclear nonproliferation, among other causes.\par \par \uc2 Active until the end of his life, Mr. Beinecke had lunch the week before his death with recipients of a scholarship he endowed at Columbia Law School; he had a series of social engagements planned for the following week. His daughter Frances said that on the day he died, Mr. Beinecke had a bow tie selected for his weekly bridge game at the Yale Club.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b ART\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 William S.

Beinecke and his wife, Betty, moved to the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1979, they were shocked by the dilapidated state of Central Park. Far from the emerald jewel that Mr. Beinecke recalled from childhood visits to his grandparents' New York apartment, the park had become strewn with litter, its buildings covered with graffiti, its gardens full of weeds and its benches broken and rusting.\par \par \uc2 ''It bothered us to see the park in such a state of disrepair and decay,'' Mr. Beinecke wrote in a memoir years later, ''but we weren't sure what to do about it.''\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 They didn't wait long to find out. In the spring of 1980, the Beineckes stopped by the city's Parks Department to ask how they could help. Unbeknown to them, the parks commissioner at the time, Gordon J. Davis, and a colleague were establishing a partnership to support the park. They had the support of Mayor Edward I. Koch but had struck out recruiting a chairman who could tap into the city's business community. Mr. Beinecke, newly retired from a successful corporate career, was the ideal candidate.\par \par \uc2 ''He literally just walked in the door,'' Mr. Davis recalled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke (pronounced BUY-neh-key) agreed to serve as the first chairman of what became the Central Park Conservancy, and quickly recruited to the board many of the same corporate leaders who had previously turned Mr. Davis down. The conservancy is widely credited with helping to revitalize the park, and has served as a model for similar public-private partnerships across the country.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 103.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke lived in New Jersey for much of his life -- he grew up in Cranford and raised his family in Summit -- but he had a lifelong connection to New York. His paternal grandfather, Bernhard Beinecke, was a German immigrant and entrepreneur who built the Plaza Hotel, at the southeast corner of Central Park. Mr. Beinecke wrote that one of his earliest memories was of watching from his family's 12th-floor suite at the Plaza as returning veterans from World War I paraded up Fifth Avenue.\par \par \uc2 His professional life likewise had a family connection. Mr. Beinecke spent his career at the \uc2 Sperry & Hutchinson Company\uc2 , which his maternal grandfather, William Sperry Miller, founded with a partner in 1896. The company became well-known for its Green Stamps, which customers earned by shopping at participating gasoline stations and grocery stores and could trade in for rewards.\par \par \uc2 S & H, as the company was known, benefited greatly from the rise of the suburban middle class after World War II. Mr. Beinecke, who served as the company's chairman and chief executive in the 1960s and \u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u178\'00\'B270s, took the company public in 1966 and diversified its holdings into furniture and other businesses.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Beinecke saw his business and philanthropic endeavors as sharing a common purpose, and embraced the idea of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2  long before that phrase became fashionable. That impulse led him to wage a decades-long campaign to persuade \uc2 Yale University\uc2  to create a business school, which he saw as a way for the university to engage with -- and help shape -- the rise of corporations as a force in American civic life.\par \par \uc2 The proposal initially faced opposition from some at the university, who saw it as a distraction from Yale's core liberal arts mission. But Mr. Beinecke and his allies eventually prevailed, and the Yale School of Management opened in 1976, with the Beineckes as major benefactors.\par \par \uc2 ''In my 30-odd years in business, few things have surprised and disappointed me more than the attitude many businessmen have about the world beyond their business and their careers,'' Mr. Beinecke said in a speech in 1983 commemorating the founding of the school. ''Even men of the highest capacity will, without regret, limit themselves to a two-course curriculum -- they major in bottom-line and minor in golf.''\par \par \uc2 William Sperry Beinecke was born on May 22, 1914, in New York City, to Frederick W. Beinecke and the former Carrie Sperry.\par \par \uc2 After earning his bachelor's degree, in economics, from Yale and a law degree from \uc2 Columbia University\uc2 , he joined the Navy as the United States was preparing to enter World War II. He went on to serve on destroyers in the Atlantic and Pacific, and left the Navy as a lieutenant commander.\par \par \uc2 Weeks before he was called to active duty in 1941, Mr. Beinecke married the former Elizabeth Gillespie. She died in 2009. Mr. Beinecke is survived by two sons, Frederick and John; two daughters, Frances Beinecke and Sarah Beinecke Richardson; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.\par \par \uc2 When he returned from the war, Mr. Beinecke briefly practiced law before joining \uc2 Sperry & Hutchinson\uc2  as general counsel in 1951. At S & H, he helped fight efforts in several states to restrict or ban Green Stamps and similar rewards programs as anticompetitive.\par \par \uc2 He retired in 1980 and embarked on what amounted to a second career in philanthropy. Besides his work for Central Park and Yale, where Mr. Beinecke was a trustee, he was the founding chairman of the \uc2 Hudson River Foundation\uc2  and served on the boards of the New York Botanical Garden and the \uc2 American Museum of Natural History\uc2 . The Prospect Hill Foundation, which Mr. and Mrs. Beinecke created in 1959, has supported programs in the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  and nuclear nonproliferation, among other causes.\par \par \uc2 Active until the end of his life, Mr. Beinecke had lunch the week before his death with recipients of a scholarship he endowed at Columbia Law School; he had a series of social engagements planned for the following week. His daughter Frances said that on the day he died, Mr. Beinecke had a bow tie selected for his weekly bridge game at the Yale Club.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b ART\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 In addition to helping revitalize Central Park, William S.

The tactic is helping Mr. Danhof promote and engage with company management on conservative social-policy issues.\par \cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {  \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\row} \trowd\trgaph15\trqc\trleft-15 \clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx720\clvertalt\clpadl15\clpadr-15 \cellx9360\pard \qr \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \b TD\b0\cell \pard \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 \uc2 Mr. Danhof, who decided to take advantage of the regulatory quirk last summer, worked to submit a shareholder proposal in November demanding \uc2 General Electric Co\uc2 . divulge more information about its lobbying expenditures.\par \par \uc2 The conservative advocate's documents arrived at GE on Nov. 6. A nearly identical proposal from the \uc2 New York State Common Retirement Fund\uc2  arrived two days later.\par \par \uc2 The statements supporting the two resolutions were polar opposites. Mr. Danhof said GE need not hide its contributions because it should "be proud of its membership in trade associations\u8230\'20\'26that promote pro-business, pro-growth initiatives."\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the New York state fund called for greater transparency on such spending so shareholders can "fully evaluate the political use of corporate assets."\par \par \uc2 Securities rules meant Mr. Danhof's proposal made it to the company's 2018 proxy, which goes to vote on April 25, and beat out New York's nearly identical version.\par \par \uc2 A company can ask the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  to exclude a resolution from its ballot if it is "substantially duplicative" of a proposal submitted earlier by another shareholder. That was the case with GE, which petitioned the regulator to exclude the state's proposal.\par \par \uc2 "I knew the liberals were going to file their resolution blasting membership [in certain trade and lobby groups]\u8230\'20\'26so I filed a resolution with the same language," said Mr. Danhof, general counsel at the National Center for Public Policy Research. The conservative research and communications foundation is one of a handful of right-leaning organizations using shareholder resolutions.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Danhof's strategy for the 2018 proxy season is to make the best use of this new tactic: Submit the same proposal as a left-leaning shareholder, but get it in first.\par \par \uc2 Investors have long relied on shareholder resolutions\u8212\'20\'14proposed by some stock owners and included in a company's proxy for a vote by all shareholders\u8212\'20\'14to wring greater accountability from boards.\par \par \uc2 Shareholders filed 1,347 resolutions focused on social policy and the \b \highlight22\uc2 environment\b0 \highlight\uc2  with Fortune 250 companies in the decade ended in 2015, according to ProxyMonitor.org.\par \par \uc2 None of them garnered majority shareholder support.\par \par \uc2 That's starting to change. A proposal seeking greater disclosure of political spending by \uc2 Fluor Corp\uc2 . passed in 2016. And last year, fund managers BlackRock Inc. and \uc2 Vanguard Group\uc2  voted with the proponents of climate-risk disclosure at \uc2 Exxon Mobil Corp\uc2 . and \uc2 Occidental Petroleum Corp\uc2 . among others.\par \par \uc2 "The comfort level in a boardroom changes when you get large global investors supporting or even voting for an environmental resolution," said Timothy Smith, director of shareholder engagement at \uc2 Walden Asset Management\uc2 , a $3.6 billion sustainable-investments fund.\par \par \uc2 The shift spurred Mr. Danhof to take up shareholder resolutions with new gusto.\par \par \uc2 "Every other group that engages with corporations on social policy is liberal," he said. "They are pushing a very far-left agenda."\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Center\uc2 , a 35-year-old Washington-based organization, submits 15 to 25 proposals each year on issues such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, and corporate charitable contributions.\par \par \uc2 This isn't the first time Mr. Danhof got a proposal on GE's proxy. Last year, he requested the company disclose its charitable contributions, citing concerns over reports that GE had donated to \uc2 the Clinton Foundation\uc2  and Planned Parenthood. GE declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Danhof's latest GE proposal dealt a setback to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who has emphasized environmental, social and governance issues as trustee of the Common Retirement Fund.\par \par \uc2 "It's questionable whether these shadow proposals share the same sincerity and concern for managing risk to investors' portfolios or are merely cynical attempts to sideline legitimate shareholder proposals," Mr. DiNapoli said in a emailed statement.\par \par \uc2 The fund is the third-largest public pension fund in the U.S., with $209 billion under management, and will look to file its proposals earlier next year, a spokesman said.\par \par \uc2 Proposals, even those that failed to get on the proxy, have led to increased dialogue between companies and shareholders in recent years as submissions on environmental and social issues grew, said governance experts at law firm Cleary Gottlieb.\par \par \uc2 The swing toward greater shareholder engagement has worked for Mr. Danhof. A campaign to ensure employees' rights to private political activity led to greater protections at 13 companies, he said.\par \par \uc2 "Filing a proposal is an opening, to encourage discussion, and it can lead to truthful negotiations to advance the issues we're focused on," he said.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Center\uc2  filed a lobbying-expenditures proposal with \uc2 Duke Energy Corp\uc2 . on Nov. 16. A day later, a virtually identical proposal arrived from a social-investing group, the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia.\par \par \uc2 The group intends to vote against the \uc2 National Center\uc2 's proposal "since the philosophy of the Center is quite different from ours," said Nora Nash, director of \b \highlight22\uc2 corporate social responsibility\b0 \highlight\uc2 , in an email.\par \par \uc2 Duke representatives didn't respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 National Center\uc2  will continue to deploy shareholder resolutions, not least because its new first-come, first-served submission tactic is scoring points with relatively few resources.\par \par \uc2 "Compared to the billions of dollars that the left puts toward this, we would never be able to catch up," Mr. Danhof said. "So we will just chip away, as much as we can."\par \par \uc2 Write to Mara Lemos Stein at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "mailto:mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2
