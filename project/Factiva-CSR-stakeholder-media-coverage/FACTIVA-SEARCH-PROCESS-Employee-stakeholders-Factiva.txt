I adapted Flammer's (2013) process for searching for coverage of environmental stakeholder corporate social responsibility coverage. 
I searched for CSR related to employees by searching the Factiva database for "corporate social responsibility" AND "employee*" for All dates, all authors, all companies, all subjects, all industries, all regions, and all languages.

The search returned 25,392 results (25,049 documents) (Duplicates set to "Off"). Dow Jones publications had 1,652 hits, Web News 327, Blogs 15, Pictures 0, and Multimedia 1.
