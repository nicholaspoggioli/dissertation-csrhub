I adapted Flammer's (2013) process for searching for coverage of environmental stakeholder corporate social responsibility coverage. I searched for CSR related to customers by searching the Factiva database for "corporate social responsibility" AND "customer*" for All dates, all authors, all companies, all subjects, all industries, all regions, and all languages.

The search returned 32,300 results (31,843 documents) (Duplicates set to "Off"). Dow Jones publications had 1,971 hits, Web News 446, Blogs 9, Pictures 0, and Multimedia 2.
