 argues the business case for CSR (i.e., the theory predicting a positive
 effect of CSP on CFP) depends in part on a firm's history of social performance.
 He refines the basic model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:basic model"

\end_inset

 by adding a firm's history of social performance 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 to the model: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
CFP=f(H,\,CSP)\label{eq:barnett 2007 addition of stakeholder influence capacity}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Barnett labels a firm's history of CSP its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

stakeholder influence capacity

 and argues that the longer a firm has been engaged in CSR around a particular
 issue, the more stakeholder influence capacity the firm has to affect the
 behavior of stakeholder groups concerned about that issue.

 of whether primary stakeholders demand the firm do so.

 CSR characteristics that matter to the CFP-CSP relationship are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

: Time between event and CSR response.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

The full model of CFP now splits

\begin_layout Subsection
Importance of stakeholder characteristics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Barnett (2007) argues firm characteristics matter to the CFP-CSP relationship,
 and Barnett (2016) argues CSR characteristics matter.
 Building on these works, I argue stakeholder characteristics matter, too,
 yet remain missing from theory about the CFP-CSP relationship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous research on how managers should prioritize stakeholder demands
 is limited in its consideration of the different stakeholder characteristics
 that affect the CFP-CSP relationship.
 Most prior theorization treats all stakeholders the same, regardless of
 which particular social issue the stakeholder cares about.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Mitchell1997"

\end_inset

 suggests three stakeholder characteristics determine whether a firm should
 prioritize a paritcular stakeholder group: the group's power, legitimacy,
 and urgency.
 I argue a fourth stakeholder characteristic needs to be added to this list:
 the social problem around which the group organizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I argue Barnett's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Barnett2016"

\end_inset

 attempt to link a firm addressing society's needs to corporate performance
 is incomplete without a more complete consideration of how stakeholder
 groups are distinguished by caring about different social problems.
 How a stakeholder group affects the CFP-CSP relationship depends on the
 social problems a firm addresses with its CSR and which it ignores.
 Even the largest, most resource-rich firms cannot address all social problems,
 and managers need to prioritize which social problems to engage with through
 CSR actions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Barnett2016"

\end_inset

.
 If the CFP-CSP differs by stakeholder characteristics, we might not be
 able to determine the exact character of such heterogeneity by studying
 the relationship between a firm's CFP and all of its CSR activity combined,
 which is the typical model in which financial performance measures are
 regressed on net CSR measures like KLD scores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The traditional view of the stakeholder characteristics that matter to the
 CFP-CSP relationship is quite limited to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Barnett2016"

\end_inset

 refines CSP to account for some firm and CSR characteristics.
 I argue characteristics of stakeholders also matter to the CSP-CFP relationship.
 I theorize these relationships in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Empirical evidence that stakeholder characteristics matter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Empirical tests of the CFP-CSP relationship tend to measure CSP as a singular
 outcome, typically a net KLD score.
 Some studies using the singular outcome conduct supplementary analyses
 breaking the CSP outcome into separate outcomes for different stakeholder
 groups.
 But a long tradition has argued that CSP is not a single outcome but a
 "multidimensional construct" (Carroll 1979, cited in Mattingly 2017).
 Some papers have begun mentioning and empirically identifying variation
 across stakeholder groups in the CFP returns to CSP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Flammer2015a"

\end_inset

 explores three channels through which CSP might affect CFP:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Environmental-related CSR catering to customers who care about environmentalism,
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CSR attracting better employees and/or increasing employee satisfaction
 which both lead to higher CFP through higher labor productivity, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
CSR fostering investment in more efficient technologies or production processes
 (but note Flammer does not distinguish between this last being driven by
 financial logic/competition versus commitment to environmental responsibility.
 That is also one unresolved confound in the entire greening the firm literature
)).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flammer (2015) reports a positive effect of CSR-related shareholder proposal
 passage and CFP.
 Supplementary anlaysis suggests how the effect might operate through different
 channels relevant to different stakhoelder groups.
 Proposal adoption increases sales growth, suggesting the increase happens
 through appealing to specific customer groups that prioritize certain aspects
 of CSR.
 Proposal adoption increases labor productivity, suggesting the increase
 happens through employee stakeholder group by attracting better employees
 and/or increasing employee commitment.
 Proposal adoption has no effect on physical investment; while this suggests
 the effect does not operate through motivating investment in more efficient
 processes, Flammer cautions that the result "does not necessarily reject
 the investment channel" (p.
 2563) because proposal adoption might motivate executives to reduce emissions
 by closing poorly-performing plants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Flammer and Bansal (2017) report a positive effect on CFP of adopting long-term
 management compensation plans.
 Supplementary analysis finds adopting long-term compensation plans increases
 firms' reputation for employee- and environment-related CSR but only weakly
 or not at all their reputation for consumer- or society-based CSR.
 Flammer (2013) reports a positive effect of announcing eco-friendly actions
 on market value, but the effect is smaller for firms with higher past levels
 of environmental CSR, supporting Barnett's 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "Barnett2007"

\end_inset

 argument that a firm's history of CSR will moderate the effect of a firm's
 CSR on stakeholder relations.
 This suggests some of the effect of CSP on CFP is itself affected by a
 firm's mix of stakeholder groups and its past stakeholder management of
 those groups.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 found environmental and employee-related CSP positively related to CFP,
 but CSP related to other stakeholder groups was unrelated to CFP.

 and long-run stock market value and explored how the CFP-CSP relationship
 works when the CSP is focused on stakeholders concerned about labor issues.
